However, dont waste your time with this sh*t. Poorly optimized, horrid hit registry and pathetic guns and classes. This game encourages team work but doesnt have the basic gameplay fundamentals to support a range of approaches. Your time will be spent walking through fields, looking at low textured walls and hillsides untill someone you cant see, either its due to poor render distance and resolution or theyre just straight up the master of disguise, pushes your brain out of your skull. When this game does go well it is at best a lot of shooting at areas where you think enemies might be, until you are killed and forced to spawn across the map and run all the way back because your squad leader forgot to put down a spawn beacon. Just do yourself a favour, if you want big open spaces and to pretend to be a 'real soldier', play arma. If you want devastating gunplay with walls and surfaces with actual textures, play Insurgency.

The worlds consist only of lego bricks - you can delete just about every brick and place most ""simple"" bricks (e.g. 2x4 bricks) in any colour you want, but no specialist bricks (e.g. flags) can be placed. Hopefully the ability to place these specialist bricks will come out in the near futureAs you play your Lego World, there are different objects, such as plants and cauldrons, that you unlock by paying in studs you can earn from destroying these objects, allowing them to be placed. Furthermore, there are npcs that you can unlock to play as, as well as using their clothes to create a custom character. There are also animals and vehicles that you can ride, which also must be unlockedThe camera is quite good when walking or riding around, but when building, it is not very precise, and difficult to line objects up. i have also encountered a glitch where shift+tabbing out stops me from moving the camera angle.Building in the game could possibly be a bit better, perhaps more akin to the controls of lego digital designer, and as mentioned before, the camera prevents accurate block placement in many instancesCurrently the game has no set objectives and also has little in the way of models and items. However, the current items and models are very detailed and useful, and I am sure that there will be hundreds of more exciting models that will be able to be placedUltimitely, the game has an array of exciting features and unique worlds, and is priced exceptionally well. Although some of the controls are a bit finicky, I am sure as the game develops further controls will be streamlinedThis game is definitely a good buy if you are interested in the world building genre, and obviously if you like LegoPros-Exciting and unique worlds-Great prebuilt models-Npcs that you can dress as-Vehicles and animals are fun-Movement controls are excellentCons-Camera can be a bit dodgy-Building is not always precise-Lacks a large amount of models and objects (but being early access there will be more added, so this point will be pointless in the near future)",2015-06-05,51,76561198059711106,332310,LEGO  Worlds,146,0,1

This game is set in an open world and works like a real world zombie apocalypse if you die you dont respawn you just change characters and keep going. If you tell an NPC to acompany you and they die, they are dead and you will never get them back.The story is awesome with you starting off with 3 people and slowly building from there while trying to get out of the place. Every playthrough is different because you could die early and make it so those 3 friends die before finishing the game.Apart from that there are also 2 completely different DLC's that just add to the chaos making the zombies harder and changing the map so you don't have to keep looking at the same place over and over again.

Doesn't suffer from being an open world experience, but probably doesn't benefit greatly from it either. Boss battles are virtually non existent, which is a real let down as these have always been a significant part of the experience.The visuals are great, however as a PC port it has poor-ish performance with AMD grapphics cards and dual GPU support isn't anywhere to be found, so ultra HD resolutions or even ultrawide resolutions simply won't be possible. Nvidia gameworks needs to stop being a thing.The story however is awful, Chapter 1 is strong however Chapter 2 is padded out with mission replays, very few story missions and the final game mission was cut. Finishing the game feels very unusual, you will notice the lack of content without a doubt. Howeber even in general terms the story lacks the characters and development seen in previous games, so even when it's working, the story isn't really up to the franchise standards.I would recommend this game sure enough, but MGS fans will be sorely disapointed and people unfamiliar with MGS are probably set to have the most rewarding experience.

Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering ""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).",2014-11-14,300,76561198059582003,222880,Insurgency,102,0,1

Shooting people and slaughtering the vox populi are just a small part of what is contained in this wonderful game. Other parts being the awesome story, confusing parallel worlds (you'll understand at the end) and heaps more. Irrational games has done a great job on bioshock Infinite, keeping it linked to the original series as much as possible. Ken Levine has managed to capture the feel of Bioshock in many ways. I love the graphics and how simple and great they are. The story didnt seem that important at first, but later on it gets important and amazing.

Every play through is a blast and you will never have the same run twice as there are randomly generated rooms and floors to explore. However in some aspects the game's enjoyment is withered and incredibly frustrating within the first 10-20 hours of gameplay, and as a result you will die ALOT.One of the finest elements that refine the game is it's randomly generated level, this gives the player LOADS of replayability and intrigue in what might happen next time I play. With these randomly generated levels, the designers also placed over 20 bosses that get more and more challenging as you progress and strategies may need to be employed to bring them down. But it doesn't stop there, there are close to 100 items that you can collect which alters the game mechanics and even your characters appearance, and that's not even including DLC. With every game there are the negatives and we must discuss them, so what's wrong with this game? Well the first 10-20 hours will kick you in the    . You will die many, many times and if you don't learn from these mistakes and adapt to an enemies fighting capability you will keep getting your     kicked. Also be prepared to open up a wiki because when you pickup an item for the first time, there is no telling what it will initially do. However if you can manage to have the patience to get over that first 10-20 hour hurdle, then the game will be a blast.Too long didn't read, let me summarise:                   **Positives**                                                                                                         +Randomly generated levels                                                                     +No two runs will be the same                                                                    +Tons of unique bosses items and enemies (also mini bosses)               +Comedic tone and references throughout game                    **Negatives**-Almost sadistic first 10-20 hours-No item descriptions/ blandly tells you item functions (WTF!?)-Almost unplayable without consulting the WikiThis game is undoughtably fun, don't let those negatives throw you off, this game deserves to be played. I payed $10 for this game, and Iv'e probably milked about 5 times it's value out of it. For $5 on Steam + $3 DLC (that you should only buy once you've completed the game several times) this game is a bargain and deserves your utmost attention.**9/10**",2013-12-10,77,76561198059584657,113200,The Binding of Isaac,31,0,1

The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today. The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the  other world . Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude. As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York. Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale. Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map. The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various  other world  levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right). The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the  other world . These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word  PROFILING  fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many  static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the  other world , these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred. Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as  Shadows . These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.Continued...",2014-01-08,291,76561198061191470,247660,Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut,244,0,1

At first everything was so simple, the supplies in my house were fine and I can loot abandonded houses when the food was running low, but then things changed. The first time I commited evil was in an old house, I had pavle looting it and found it to be inhabited, the people saw me after I stole some of their things, they tried to make me leave, I saw this as a threat, so I killed an approaching man with a gun, after this a woman cowered in fear and begged for mercy, I killed her, she wanted to kill me right? I then realised what I had done, but I was so desperate for supplies I kept going. My character had breif depression after that.I thought I had it bad then. I was very low on supplies, a new girl asked to join my group of three and promised to pull her wait if we deided to take her in, I accepted her request. Immediently afterwards she bacame sick, I then had no medicine left. Then my character Marko went out scavenging, there were people there. They seemed to be nice but I couldn't find what I needed searching through the rubble. Bruno was desperate for bandages, Pavles depression had been lashed out on him even though he was trying to help. I thought it would be ok if I just saw was in the private property, it would be right? Wrong. I looked through it, there was no bandages, the man whose property it was then tried to kill me. And he did. Marko died.That loss was tolerable. I had Arica scavenging for supplies, I hit the jackpot, but as I tried to leave there was a barred door, I could have easly gone around it however I intended on returning here so I decided to break it open, as I did a raider hearrd. That was Arica's end.That really did it for Pavle, he had no chance left, he just kept breaking down even more, I had to have Bruno do all of the work. They were doing ok, then Bruno died. Suicide.Things were really bad then, every night when Bruno scavenged everthing I had would be stolen. Eventullay though tt didn't matter, I just took important things with me.Things were really looking up, I had nearly everything I needed, Bruno was well fed and had plenty of sleep, I thought I may actually be able to survive for quite a while still.There was just one problem. Depression.Bruno commited suicide.I survived 18 days. 10/10 Would have all my characters commit suicide or die for stupid reasons again.Really though.

In a way there is more to choose from when you shoot someone. They also have added X-ray shots on vehicles so thats really awesome exploding vehicles. There is now new weapon customization and new weapons like the Italian Carcano rifle and the German panzershreck. And new enemies not Germans and Russians but now again Germans and Italians, in a way i liek that as the Italians aren't really recognised much in WWII.

I didn't rush ahead and pre-purchase a game that could be either really impressive or unstable/un-playable. Coincidently it turned out upon release that the game was terrible (cough* cough* rushed by SEGA as evident in other titles cough* cough* COH2). So i waited; regulary reading reviews, watching gameplay and dev changelogs. I then purchased the game when the emperor editon was released. Instantaniously, the ratio of positive and negative reviews was leaning towards the positive approach. So i purchased the game  with the Greek states DLC on a steam sale Sepember last year for a great price of $20.At that point in which i purchased the game i was impressed, beautiful graphics, animations and mechanics which were not exactly historically accurate but were enjoyable and rewarding. If i had any negative comeents at this current stage, it would be the numerous overpriced DLCs which i believe was influenced by SEGA (cough* cough* COH2 has the same issue). Another complaint is the weakness of the Greek Hoplite/Pike phalanx. I do not like the fact that sword beats the dori phalanx as historically if a unit collided head on with a phalnx, they would become what is known as the modern day souvlaki. I rate this game 92/100 at its CURRENT stage.",2015-02-17,10,76561198059615734,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,0,0,1

I spent 40 minutes going in circles around the dungeon trying to find a character with directions, heh.anyway, a very good game for the price, doesn't take too long to beat (only took me 5 hrs) and I am hoping very much for a sequel. Also, if you enjoyed this, you might enjoy the labyronia rpg series, if you haven't already tried it, ty have fun :)",2024-09-07,73,76561198057989039,418190,Helen's Mysterious Castle,73,0,1

I LL MAKE THE FIRST PART AS SPOILER FREE AS POSSIBLE THEN LATER ON MENTION SPECIFICS WHICH MIGHT BE SPOILERS. I have waited . SO long for this book, to finally play it has been great and really happy to finally get an ending to the story. So, storyline. The story line is mostly great, to summarise it you have two worlds one of magic, one of science and both can be affected by each other and I won t mention exactly how because you know, spoilers but yeah it s interesting. I really loved the fact you have 2 worlds and one semi world/ in-between world? Anyway these three worlds you play in and eventually they begin to merge then finally they all meet at one point. Look, as of writing this it s on sale for about US$10.20 which, if you re paying in Australian dollarydoos or Canadian Maple Money/ Monopoly money is a bit more than that but at that it s worth it to play the story.  Things I really liked    I loved the fact you could examine just about anything(Because I m a nosey      I suppose) and get a character s thoughts and at times humorous dialogue or little bits. For example, examine a rocket and get character dialogue of  Ground control to Major Tom!  Nice touch. Makes more sense given the rough era the area is based on.  I like the fact choices do seem to matter, think of it like a stat check. A string of choices could have an affect later and a couple times I found myself thinking      , I made a bad decision last book. Bad things are going to happen  That or regret a decision after it was made.  The scenes are pretty beautiful. Especially europolis, it s always dark and rainy. Your apartment is small but still very beautiful and I just love that city and contrasting medieval style city. Very nice.  The characters are great. I especially like Zoe, Enu, Mira, Crow and      Bot. Specifically Enu, she is so ditsy and cute and awkward.   Miner dislikes/ gripes  It could be a little slow sometimes to go from place to place just to do something seemingly simple.  It would have been nice to see more of some characters to really get more of a feel for the world and be more engrossed within it.   Now, I d just like to chuck on some quotes form the game I found particularly amusing before the small spoiler section down below later.    I need to be in that body. And I need to stop sounding like a pervert.    Affirmative. I will stop doing this thing that I live that makes me happy and fulfilled to follow you on our pointless, depressing journey.    Requests for sexual favours will be bogged and reported to the appropriate authorities. WATIcorp adbots do not  talk dirty  or perform fellatio.    Every step you take  I ll be watching you, as mandated by martial law.   ..  How about every breath I oh I give up   MOVING SLIGHTLY INTO SPOILER TEROTORY NOW FOR BOOK 5 AND POTENTIALLY PRECIDING BOOKS Things I really liked (cont)     symbolism maybe?  I m not up with Buddhism or things within it but in book 5 Zoe comments on the  between world  place being like a Buddhist temple. Might be some form of a reference to something from Buddhist beliefs but not sure.  The choices I made meant that in the story line I made good with people. And I m so glad I did, just a few different decisions and maybe that wouldn t be the case.  ",2024-06-19,202,76561198060492617,237850,Dreamfall Chapters,0,0,1

It was developed by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE), a well known game development company behind MMOs such as Everquest, DC Universe, and the original Planetside. As it's name suggests, it takes place in humanity's future on the faraway planet of Auraxis.Three powerful factions: the Terran Republic, New Conglomerate, and Vanu Sovereignty, slug it out to control as much territory and resources as possible. You fight on 4 unique continents (large maps), where huge, often awesome battles with infantry, ground vehicles and aircraft occur. Planetside 2 is a game to be played with a squad or platoon of friends, as playing lone wolf can be difficult, repetitive, and at times, boring.In organised outfits (clans), though, the game can create great memories. It requires a decent computer, and it's detailed large-scale environments and battles can take down the fps on cheaper rigs.

It is definitely not your average dating sim and that is a fact that we know. To be honest, I'm not the usually one to mess with dating sims nor am I one to be into this side of games but this somehow bypassed my attention since it was a bit more intersting than what I thought.When I first started playing this, I was more afraid of the ""sightings"" at first or what I might be in for but as I progressed through it started to become second nature and I will say this to those who are in this position, just let it happen, it will end.This is one true masterpiece due to it's playability and of course, good choice of appearance and personality to each girl and it mixes quite nicely and with it being a mix of ""Candy Crush"" as everyone would say, think or express (which makes sense since it is pretty much the only game that not many people can tear themselves away from other than Bejeweled). I would also like to add the end, is never the end.

Granted, we were given an infinite universe to explore, space battles, trading and upgrading, and I truly enjoyed the time I had to do all those things, but those things lose its charm almost after the first few days of playing (3-4 hours a gaming session). After the first few planets and galaxies, I was left the thought, ""Now what?"". Explore more planets? Sure why not. But after a while, each undiscovered planet I came across only had me going,"" eh, I'll check that out later"". For a game that's all about exploring planets while travelling to the center of the universe, being bored of exploration shouldn't be happening. But it does. Why? Because while all planets are supposedly unique in terms of flora and fauna, you're pretty much expecting to see the same thing. I was told that I can try to learn all the alien languages and words, but I asked myself, ""Why though? Most of the time, I can make out what they are saying despite the broken english"". ""Upgrade your ship/suit/tool to max!"" BUT WHY?! It'll only make doing the same thing (exploring the galaxy full of lifeless planets) that more convenient. I'll be seeing the same planets over and over again, just with a different colored sky.I feel that this game will have no man left to explore the skies of countless, yet lifeless, planets. I fell into the hype, and I'm paying the price ( $80 AUD ). I wanted to like this game! If anything I hate the fact that I hate this game. I wish I coule get a refund before I hit the 2 hour mark, but I was being optimistic hoping that there is something more if I just kept at it. Apparently with this game, its not about getting to the destination, but rather the journey to getting there. After playing for a while, I wanted to get to the center as fast as possible just so I can feel satisfied in spending $80 and be done with it.",2024-08-23,54,76561198059854102,275850,No Man's Sky,690,0,0

BUGS, CRASHES. So I ended up getting a new PC and playing Watch Dogs it about 3 months after that. And It was pretty good. I did like the story, I enjoyed hacking into things going into the clubs. You know, you usual. The Only thing that really bothered me was that in cutscenes I couldn't hear the voices; only the music. But all well at least Ubisoft didn't forget to put in subtitles!

I am really trying to finish this game, if only to find out if it is actually possible to die from boredom.This is the worst Assassin's Creed game to date. I've had more fun in the first five minutes of Black Flag or Revelations than I have had in the first few hours of this game.Avoid this steaming dung pile if it is your first Assassin's Creed game. It will ruin the franchise for you.------Post finish update.Well I finished it, and can say it is not possible to die of boredom.Which is a good thing seeing that's what this game is in a nutshell.I even started the post game pivot points hunt, until I realised, why bother. Sure it unlocks cheats, but if turned on, most of them causes your game to reset when you disable them.So I played one round of bowls with George Washington then kissed the main game goodbye. (If by kiss you mean the raising of ones middle finger)*SPOILERS this paragraph only*The game insulted me many times but the best insult was after I chased down Charles Lee. Connor was massivly injured, and I made my way to the frontier, as you may know, you can't run or fight at this point. However, as I'm dragging Connor's broken body towards the inn a notification pops up telling me to attack a convoy! It then tells me the convoy is leaving, followed by a failure to attack said convoy notification. I laughed so hard at this, but not in a good way, in the kind of a way that said, ""You, Ubisoft should never be allowed to forget how bad this stink heap of a notgame your brand name is attached to, and that every person who appears in the 20+ min of credits should hand write an apology to anyone who owns a copy of this...thing.""Then I tried the DLC game, the Tyranny of King George blah blah whatever.The most amazing thing about this DLC is that I actually had more fun in the first 15 minutes of this than the whole of the main game. Sad really.This was not to last however as I saw that everyone who was noble and good in the main game was now a baddie, and the full sync requirements are even harder. Luckily, the whole story is all just a piece of eden created dream. Which is more than I can say for it.So, after nearly uninstalling Assassin's Creed 3 after the hideous mini game of breaking up the wood mill workers fight, or after being eaten by those wolves at Kidd's treasure Island for the hundreth time (before I used trip mines on the buggers!), or trying, trying and trying again to tackle that officer from above but never succeeding (although I did keep leaping onto his mates for some reason). Instead it was here, after the main game, but only a bit into the DLC I realised I've had enough of a game that isn't actually fun. In fact, after I clicked uninstall I realised how much more fun it was doing that than 90% of Assassin's Creed 3. I should get an achivement for that!My verdict is, watch this as a playthrough on Youtube. If you really need to.Then play Black Flag.",2015-08-04,300,76561198059582003,208480,Assassin's Creed  III,1029,0,0

With the added bonus of console commands, the player can also spawn an infinite number of resources, blueprints and equipment which adds to the game's accessibility - I first used console commands to get a ""feel"" for the game and have opted to start over without for a real survival experience.

Either the designs are poor, the funding is clearly lacking and it will never be completed, or they're simply not fun to pay. There's usually a reason a developer can't find a publisher.Not so with Road Redemption. I'm stunned this hasn't been picked up by a publisher already. The visuals are solid, the gameplay is hilarious and bombastic, the weapons and tracks are diverse, interesting and feel excellent to use. Most of all, this is a     ing VIDEO GAME. It's such a         video game you don't even know - it's just a freaking blast to play, a huge amount of fun. The upcoming multiplayer component is extremely promising as well. The only thing lacking might be the music, which is somewhat generic, as well as some variability in the missions.

Some semblance of story although a bit jumbled, no solid thread of story with a hodge podge of repeated side missions, ark falls and random events. The environment is smaller than it should be and somewhat congested, with different activities jammed in with each other.Still fun to play in a limited fashion as a cooperative shooter, if you do not try to make any sense of it, forget the story and just do stuff at random and don't worry.One to put in the library and spend nothing on. The only thing that keeps me playing is I spent money on it early, only to find how shallow it is. They tend to nickel and dime, watch out for the packs they do not sell what they imply, items that are sold as account upgrades end up being tied to one character only, inventory space is especially problematic and being an Patron is pretty worthless. Keep your expenditure to a minimum to save disapointment.Added to this are some really lame quests, rather than them making tricky or stealthy or skilled, just enemies you need to shoot a bajillion times, it gets boring pulling the trigger again and again and again on your nerf gun ......Want a better weapon, no problem the very worst legendary weapon system ever, ties the the most ludicrous levelling system level 100 nope try 5000, this as a scam because you leave your best legendary weapons behind or spend real money trying to keep them up with your level and you will not do it with spending cash when it comes to legendary weapons.TRION pretty much suck as a F2P publisher being way to nickle and dimey, driving players away from the game, needing more revenue, become more nickel and dimey, drive more players away, need more revenue become more nickle and dimey etc.",2015-09-07,332,76561197971851704,224600,Defiance,1325,0,0

Far Cry 3 attempted to explain how Jason became a stone cold killer. There was none of this in Far Cry 4. A man came to the country to scatter ashes and now he is fighting in a civil war. Where is the logic in that? I also really hated the ending.  You had to chose between  Amita and Sabal to lead the Golden Path. Both are horrible people. Amita wants to turn the country into a drug state, which will make money not feed the people,  and Sabal is a religious extremist who executes those who defy him. Why do I have to pick between two horrible people when I just won the civil war pretty much single handedly?",2015-11-09,83,76561198059599439,298110,Far Cry 4,1068,0,1

It has some nice puzzles, the efforts placed into the creation of the game is capital, and you could learn more about the development of the game via it's website or by unlocking the director's commentary. For example, ruMpel went around his neighborhood to get ideas on map/level design. This game has at least 4 endings, but I will not be a spoilering         and tell you about all of them. However I think ALL of the endings aresaddening, because just this once I will be an inglorious        , Simon the Main protagonist kills himself. If there are secret endings, I hope I can find them myself The combat system is nice, it forces YOU to choose what to use, IE: A baton, a shotgun, and finally a hunting rifle. That was just an example of one of the combat loadouts. Speaking of combat & gameplay, there is a multiplayer mode with it's own storyline where you and a team of polisen trying to find Simon. However, somehow, you share the same hellish relm with our crippled David Leatherhoff in a grey hoodie.I recommend this game to fans of the ""Silent Hill"" series, the ""Resident Evil"" series,""Left 4 Dead"" series, and finally to everyone that has played, beaten, and enjoyed the half-life mod, ""Afraid of Monsters"".",2013-04-25,176,76561198059611702,223710,Cry of Fear,59,0,1

The performance is actually worse for me now than when I first played the game a few months ago, the only thing changed between these times are pc upgrades such as getting a high end cpu and motherboard, along with an SSD boot drive. The game itself when it decides to work is actually really good, and I would love to be able to play it. The developers should really focus on optimising their game rather than adding more stuff to bring the performance down. If you have a low-to-medium end gpu, I do not recommend getting this game at all, but if you have something high-end with 4 or more gbs of vram, then I do recommend the game.Edit: I have found a way to improve the performance, even though it still runs pretty bad, the link is: http://segmentnext.com/2015/06/10/ark-survival-evolved-tweaks-guide-to-improve-performance-and-graphics/Edit: I have recently bought a gtx 970 and the game runs pretty well with it, I still stand by the fact that you need a decent gpu to run the game in a playable state.

While the sense of abject fear and its triggers can vary from person to person, I found this game does very little in the way of actually attempting to scare you. The majority of the game is spent fumbling around in the titular machine looking for the next gate or doorway that the game has opened for you, while solving puzzles you fail to see the purpose of, as well as following a story the game refuses to explain to you. The monsters are not scary as you're not punished for looking at them, and you pretty much know what they are and why they exist from the start. There's a lacking fear of the unknown to their presence really.The game didn't really fool me - perhaps I've played too many games, but I could pretty accurately determine whether or not I should expect a monster, and the majority  of the time I did not, and nothing appeared. Its boring and devoid of enemies and basic survival mechanics in the same way that the 3rd Penumbra was. Don't bother.",2014-11-22,77,76561198059584657,239200,Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs,140,0,0

Taking inspiration from early 20th century weird fiction (namely H.P. Lovecraft, as expected), the story revolves around a private eye on a mission in an isolated village to help one ""Ethan Carter"". While playing through the opening segment, it seemed quite similar to Dark Corners of the Earth (also available on Steam, but broken as all hell) - being dumped in a disturbing setting with next to no guidance, only to figure everything out for yourself. This minimalist style of gameplay definitely works in the game's favour, as it seems to allow for a more immersive experience. There is no HUD, health bars, maps or quest icons. You have the WASD keys, the mouse, and your own two feet.Gameplay revolves around solving various puzzles, and entering the minds of those deceased to see memories shortly before their deaths. It feels slightly cliche, but isn't too over-the-top like you might expect. The game's story is unravelled through these various puzzle sequences, as you explore the village in which the game is set, learning of the characters and their relationships with one another. It's definitely not an in-depth story, but it is very engaging.Where TVoEC really shines is in its atmosphere. From the very first minute of the game, the atmosphere of this game almost smacks you in the face with how incredibly immersive it is. The stunning environments, beautifully-composed soundtrack and occasional narration from the main character provide an incredible feeling of isolation as you make your way through an empty and run-down village. It's almost unlike any game I've ever played, and has to be played to fully understand.I picked the game up off the Humble Store for $6.66 (coincidence?) and felt very satisfied with my purchase. For the RRP of $19.99 it may seem like a bit much for a game that can be finished in a few hours, but for anything ~$10 or less it's definitely a must-have for fans of mystery, horror, and weird fiction.",2015-05-10,139,76561198061385937,258520,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,31,0,1

Emmy award winning batman writer, Paul Dini, was brought on the write the project. The game takes place around the early 1990s batman comics but set in a unique universe with loose ties to the comics, animated series and nolanverse. Paul Dini took the early 1980s batman comics and adapted them into the emmy award winning animated series in a way no one else had done, modernising the stories, tieing them loosely into the films of the time and the comics and also making a dark, gritty and serious world while still keeping it sutiable for children. Paul Dini once again deliverse in this, tying the story loosly to the comics and the curent films and modernising the  90s stories but now the story is geared to a teen to adult audience and paul dini's story telling genius is back in full force.

I did like the Telltale formula when it still had gameplay in it but now its just a camera on a rail. The graphics also leave a lot to be desired, all they did different;y from their other games was remove the black border around everything which makes the game look very washed out and dull.Where the Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us held my interest through the ability to find out more about the world through exploration, this game does not offer that.  I started episode 5 and I was doing other things while playing due to the unbearable slowness of everything. Even as a ""casual"" Game of Thrones fan who loves the world and the characters that Geroge R.R Martin created, the lack of gameplay is a huge hinderance to me enjoying this game and ultimately finishing it.",2015-11-28,300,76561198059582003,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,0,0,0

Not DLC (unless it's free), actually just update the game and add something.- Improve the graphics a little. Don't change how it looks, but maybe use Sunshine on the asset store to add some volumetric light or something.- Add some wildlife to the environment.

The overall theme is something that, in this day and age, is more and more important.==================================Read Ahead if you wish to read my views on the subject matter.==================================.......Going to warn you here that this next bit may be considered a spoilerIf this is a work of fact, then... the subject has missed the point, but, that also seems to be the point, by continuing through the game you get the impression, through the tones used by Davey, his choice of words, and just the general feel of the final screens of the game, that as much as there is a need to continue to experiance the work of Coda, but, there is also deep deep regret within Davey.In the second chapter, the whisper chapter, you are automatically skipped through a maze section, (in which you have the option to turn back and complete it if you wish) but this single act, shows that, Davey hasnt actually learnt anything from the ordeal. But that may just be a choice to depict his mental state at the begining. With Davey only coming in about halfway through Coda's game design career, it's understandable the excitement you get from experiancing these new and wonderous creations from a mind that isn quite on the straight and narrow.Coda ensured that everything in his game's had a point, everything appeared done, from the gun that was useless and then skybox where you could see the end of the universe, things were done deliberatly. It's not my place to say that anything was done, or, if it was intended, or, if I could even have any minute semblance of an understanding of how  Coda worked. That's the point of the story. You dont know an artist through their work. Just like Davey when he told people that Coda was depressed, or in a bad state of mind, because of the theme of the little tidbits of game that he created.Coda just enjoyed what he did, and the pressure that Davey put on him, the rush, explains why he slowed down his development, because, Davey couldnt, didnt, wouldnt, understand the demons he had inside of him, his need to be validated through someone elses work. Did Davey put out these works as his own? Did he really add the lamp-posts into the games? You cant know, not unless Davey tells us so, and yet, its only a game.And you Cant know an artist through their works.",2015-10-07,51,76561198059711106,303210,The Beginner's Guide,50,0,1

It's sort of like Forza Horizon with better open-world and more realism.

The truth is its a game about hammers, and sometimes electro shock weapons, but mainly hammers.The beauty of Red Faction has always been manipulating your environment.   In this game your Handheld Anti-Military Miners Edition Ruiner or 'Hammer' is the tool for the job.You spend most of your time swinging the hammer around destroying what you see fit. You will happily be reaping destruction, ruthlessly destroying all you see for salvage for that next upgrade within minutes of starting the game.  On my joy of returning to this game I immediately set about swinging my hammer around gleefully searching for that next scrap pile, accidentally destroying the gun turret fortifications of a hapless rebel on my reckless journey for materials.With the hammer you can knock down buildings and smash nearly everything that isn't the red Mars into tiny pieces.Great joy is found using it as a biazarre stealth weapon, destroying enemies with ease as you leap out from crumbling walls, or lure them underneath crumbling ruins before striking out the last support beam.The story progresses by doing missions or creating destruction to allow the rebels to take control of each district.It can be overwhelming initially for a new player, but you quickly get into the swing of it and set about playing the game the way you want with numerous vehicles, weapons and distractions.  A personal favorite distraction of mine is completing challenges where I aim to demolish a building as fast as possible.Really there's not as much to do in it as in GTA V, or Just Cause 2, but what it does do it does very well.  If you want to reshape the battlefield around you with either a mallet or hammer this is the game for you.Highly recommended!  Its a classic and is well deserving of a go.(ps: ignore my play time.  I only spent a quarter of my time online when playing this).",2014-12-29,341,76561198059818459,20500,Red Faction: Guerrilla Steam Edition,143,0,1

It gives you little to no information and rather instead leaves you to sort of generate your own theories about it. This isn't a bad thing at all especially for people like me with ADHD. We easily get lost trying to keep up with stories and often forget important details. If you're looking for a story rich game  stop reading now and go look for something else  because you will be very disappointed. You will need some sort of controller if you wish to stand a chance in Titan Souls. The keyboard controls are pretty bad. GENERAL OVERVIEWTitan Souls is extremely simplistic and follows a pattern that you'll most likely come to love. Every boss is a 1-2 shot kill and you (the player) are also a one shot kill. Unlike many games where you the player may feel you have a huge advantage over the boss or vice versa I feel there's something special about Titan Souls. It may be weird to say but in Titan Souls I always felt I was on an even playing field since there is no progression (you never get any upgrades, throughout the entire game you have the same weapons, stats, etc) I actually came to love this. No BS, Titan Souls is all about skipping the grinding and getting straight to the chase; the bosses. COMBATCombat in TS takes a very interesting approach. You get one arrow which can be brought back to you by holding down the same button you used to fire the arrow. Your arrow will travel distance based on how long you charge it. This gives every shot meaning since whatever you fire you must either chase after or pull back towards you. The con of pulling is it you must stand still, this sounds like a very small thing but in TS this can make some very tricky situations during fights. Most fights come down to a matter of how well you can aim in fast paced situations.PRICE AND PLAY TIMEThe base game took me about three hours to complete. Upon beating the game you unlock a few other modes which can extend your play time but it's still the same game. I purchased this game during the Steam 2016 Summer Sale for about $3.75 and I can say it was definitely worth the price. I would definitely not puchase this game at full price though, I personally think AT MOST this game should be sold for around $10. I highly recommend you download the demo for this game as it gives you a few of the bosses from the game to see how you'll like it. This is the reason I bought TS and I can say the demo was in fact a pretty accurate representation of what the game itself is like.",2024-06-29,120,76561198060246333,297130,Titan Souls,276,0,1

6918,strategy,The Long Dark,2017-08-01,34.9900016784668,305620,Hinterland Studio Inc.,2017,larrythebrony,305620,"Innovation is almost always a good thing, especially in the relatively saturated and homogeneous survival genre. Procedurally generated post-apocalyptic worlds, need wood get wood, build block-based houses, form groups with other human players to survive, these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that I continue to wear to date. And who can forget the zombies.It's. Always. Another. Bloody. Ugly. Zombie.And that is why The Long Dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips. Its art-style is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the Northern Canadian Wilderness. Its rogue-like elements, such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world, shifts the player's focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode, to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of in-game days survived. And instead of surviving against zombies, players in The Long Dark are tasked to survive against Mother Nature, which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards, as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains. The sound design of The Long Dark is also extremely well done. Everything from the crunch of your soles on snow, to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for much-needed supplies, to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging, immersive, and realistic.Yes, realism is The Long Dark's home address. Being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating, but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing. The game's hunger system is also caloric based. Foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their real-life counterparts (albeit scaled up slightly). Since all activities, including sleeping and standing still, burns calories, in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day. In addition, he or she also has to drink at least 2.2litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated. On the other hand, innovation can be a two-faced      . If taken too far, it can detract immensely from a game's production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developer's time. Reinventing a tried-and-tested wheel, or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose, are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far. As much as The Long Dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre, Hinterland Studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend, and for lack of a better word, paradoxical.The biggest culprit lies in The Long Dark's surprising lack of player interaction with the environment. Besides interacting with the game's various containers that exist in the form of drawers, lockers, cupboards, stoves, starting a fire, and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer, there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment. Necessary activities such as the cooking of food, harvesting of meat from an animal's carcass, or the boiling of snow to make potable water, are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity. There is no farming, there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves. I could think of a hundred more things that a player, as a survivor in an icy wilderness, would be expected to do to survive better. Sadly, players in The Long Dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment. Why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering. It metamorphoses an otherwise open-world survival game, one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories, whether heroic or tragic, into a linear game of repetitive choices.This is not to say that The Long Dark is bereft of player-made choices. In spite of the game's limited player-environment interactivity, players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in The Long Dark. For example, constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes, thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories. Similarly, being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load. Making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy. Finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players, especially the compulsive ones, for many hours on end.Nonetheless, the negative effects on the game's longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest. Despite The Long Dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode, the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 4-5 hours of proper gameplay. Beyond that, the game starts to devolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf, foraging for wood, cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your character's physical needs, and resting in bed. There is nothing else to do. You cannot build, you cannot farm, all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end. A most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potential.At its current sale price of USD$19.99 on steam, The Long Dark is barely worth a buy. My suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hard-earned money on this game. The Long Dark will most certainly become a better game with time. On the other hand, you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now. It is one of the most polished and interesting early-access survival game that is currently available on the market. And if you enjoy a rogue-like survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate, The Long Dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment. I am therefore giving The Long Dark the thumbs up.",2015-03-02,115,76561198059637978,305620,The Long Dark,90,0,1

19608,strategy,Five Nights at Freddy's 4,2015-07-23,7.989999771118164,388090,Scott Cawthon,2015,42456,388090,"The tensest moment in Five Nights at Freddy s 4 is a one-second lean. I m leaning out of a child s bedroom, a sharp departure from the Formica wasteland of Freddy Fazbear s pizzeria, peering down a hallway swallowed in darkness. I may as well be staring into a lion s mouth. When I risk a glance out one of the two flanking doors into the dark corridors beyond, my perspective skews unnervingly. I can imagine my hands hugging the wall, an ostensible anchor against the nightmares bumping in the blackness.Nothing jumps out at me this time. The moment passes, and it's back to the same movements and mouse-clicks I ve repeated dozens of times before. I should ve yawned five minutes ago, but soon I m once more forcing my heart back down my throat for my next peek outside. This repeats for quite some minutes. If FNAF 4 needed a box blurb, it d read something like a rollercoaster of apprehension.FNAF 4 s composition is another rivet in the series steel-clad design which immortalized its Let s Play legacy in a few short months: five 8-minute nights of staying put in a room while fending off a quick death (and a nasty jumpscare) from creepy, walking animatronic animals using careful surveillance and snappily blocking access to whatever shuffles close. Loud screeches and terrifying robotic visages are common, so a strong resolve helps. Mostly.Boy meets demonAbove anything, developer Scott Cawthon s tenacity at constantly tweaking his formula for horror is almost Kubrickian in its meticulousness. FNAF 4 s fundamentals stay firmly acquainted a familiarly symmetrical room; the reprise of Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy as primary antagonists; the usage of doors as a primary defensive mechanic but its differences offer a refreshing new presentation of the risk-reward seesaw of its predecessors.Replacing the ever-troubled pizzeria from previous games is the nighttime bedroom of a kid who both substitutes for the hilariously underpaid security guard as the main character and clearly establishes his traumatic phobia of Freddy s friends with a constant Binding-of-Isaac-esque flow of tears. In a flagrant flouting of the status quo, the camera system is removed entirely. Checking for an impending attack involves running up to a door, leaning out, and clicking on a flashlight (thankfully with unlimited battery power) or slamming the door shut at the precise moment I anticipate something lunging for me.As before, staying alive demands familiarization with each animatronic s behavior. Where sight and constant camera tracking facilitated this in earlier games, FNAF 4 tosses that away for a different angle: sound. Audio cues muffled footsteps, the metallic tinkling of shifting kitchen pans, a huff of breath from something Right Beside You indicate when to use the flashlight or seal a doorway. Being proactive is essential; a single mistake invariably delivers a booming fright. I liked that avoidance of randomness in failure, as my actions and choices solely contributed to whether or not I d soon jump out of my chair.And that s really what Cawthon is best at: ensuring crystallized snapshots of stomach-dropping terror. FNAF 4 uses the sensitivity of your senses to prod out a panicked yelp every time. Does it work? Absolutely. It s absurdly rudimentary: straining to hear something barely above a whisper connects into a skull-shaking blast of sound and a horrible monster face stretched across the monitor. Of course it works.A minigame involving a plushified version of Springtrap can shave two hours off each night.But it s a bit worrisome to see an overall pivot away from what made the series so attractive in favor of a single, static mechanical loop across all five nights. The camera system, although imperfect as later nights grew more difficult, staring too long at the video screen likely meant death greatly defined the series identity. In FNAF 2, checking vents and winding the music box were integral counterparts to the cameras. FNAF 3 piled on the sinister inevitability of tracking a stalking killer.In many ways, the Five Nights games require a certain respect for their atmospheric lore, a twisted menagerie of cloudy dates, murder mysteries, and inter-relationships nearly as spaghettified as a Metal Gear Solid cutscene. Stepping into Freddy s world, like flipping open a King novel or tuning into a Carpenter classic, is an investment in putting aside disbelief and reveling in the supernatural guesswork of the genre. That s sadly tougher to pull off in Five Nights at Freddy s 4; the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over door, listen, flashlight, repeat is too much of a chore to fully pull me in.

Create a party of 4 to descend into some dark and horrific dungeon. Use the many abilities of the various classes to defeat your foes, collect treasure. Cry when your favourite hero dies. Use loots to upgrade town, improve heroes and delve in again.The different classes for heroes mean there is lots of different ways to create a party. Some classes are about straight up damage. Others are better at using damage over time effects (lower damage, but they stack AND bypass defences, but can be resisted). Some classes used a ""mark"" mechanic, marking an enemy and doing no damage, but in turn allowing powerful abilities or bonus damage on that enemy. There are CC based classes too. However the evil that dwells in the dark is merciless. You will lose heroes. Some will go crazy and wander off. Others can have so many negative traits as to be unusable.Combat is part RNG, part skill and part risk-vs-reward. Like your party is low on health, the next room is your last and it's a treasure room. You could forfeit the completion bonus but keep your heroes. Or you could fight the monsters and pray for a win. Just like in life though, sometimes things just don't go your way. Sometimes everything goes your way, but when things go bad, you(r heroes) hurt.Not only that but throughout the dungeon morale is slowly chipped away. Bad news if it drops too much, a masochistic hero that refuses a heal could well spell the end of your expedition.Be well friend, and come prepared to face the evil that lurks in the Darkest Darkness.",2024-01-20,44,76561198059603727,262060,Darkest Dungeon,128,0,1

Also the pixelly artwork is meh/normal in my opinion. The controls are fine as expected for an overrated game I mean who doesn't know a good game has good controls? Right? Ha. Anyways, let's move on to the music, the music is alright, pretty normal for an rpg yet there was some. Where they were just, very meh. And that's just my taste in music you might find it badass or something but I don't like it so that's just my opinion. Theres something in undertale I think is missing and the game itself is just terrible and good, yes the main reason I am giving this a bloody NO NO is mainly because of the fact of the story and vibe. You can't just find out what the story is, how frisk got into the place, maybe falling down, dragged down or something. The story isn't explained just right, hell even finding out the monsters creation, yes of course games like legend of zelda and other games might have this     , but their just from like not completely explained from their existance. That is sorta explained in LOZ:OOT itself, also the characters they are meh/good also if I didn't already write that.Anyways 4.9/10 this is just my opinion, you should buy it still even if it's a no no for me.Enjoy your game once you got it.",2015-11-21,31,76561198059626201,391540,Undertale,249,0,0

It is NOT a bad game. In fact, this game is amazing, and if you have never played Heroes before this game is my suggestion as to where you should start the journey. The reason for my down vote is simply because I paid $17 for nostalgia and that's pretty much it. Granted the graphics are better, but they weren't ever truly terrible for what the game was, and I feel overall not much else was done for it. It does not include all content which only adds to further disappointment and unless you're playing against people of your skill level, multiplayer is a joke (if it even works). The only solution I can see to correct this problem is to release the other 50% of the game (yes, the additional content accounted for pretty much 50% of the game) for free to those who have currently purchased the game and to add the random map generation.Whilst I still enjoy playing the game it's disappointing to know how unfinished this rerelease is, especially when it is an obvious cash-grab rereleasing a game for today's desktops.",2015-02-10,31,76561198064596888,297000,Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition,865,177,0

Quite possibly.Darkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.An incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.Playing as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of ""stress"" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.Each character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.Each character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.Actions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game. Once stress level on a character hits 100, they turn insane: acting irrational, spreading stress among party members, attacking of their own accord in battles. This is exactly what you want to avoid. I could go on about Darkest Dungeon for several pages, but that would simply be detracting from the amount of time you could be spending actually playing it. Though early access (at this moment), it's easily worth the purchase and will have you cursing for hours on end as your party members trudge through dungeons, are faced with insanity and eventually perish.Buy this game.",2015-02-25,44,76561198059603727,262060,Darkest Dungeon,128,0,1

Altough the actual combat is rather clunky in terms of animations, the game is very well developed.

An anonymous tip sends him to a mental hospital which is named Mount Massive Asylum (I know, it's a stupid name for an insane asylum). This specific asylum is owned by a company which is known for it's corrupt dealings. And has been rumored to be doing secret experiments inside the asylum itself. Upshur finds this rather interesting and decides to go to this hospital and prove whether said experiments do take place. Or not. When things quickly descend into darkness, Miles becomes more eager to get out of the building, with his sanity intact. When I first bought this game, I was excited to play it. I'd finally bought a game which only gave you limited supplies, complex puzzles and things to be afraid of. I bought it, it ran faster than  I would've expected first off. I honestly believed it would be rather slow, perhaps it's because I play it in a windowed mode, maybe not. As soon as the first chase began, I was excited, I loved the thrill of knowing that the one thing your were fighting was always behind you. And you had to do whatever you could to hide whatever was chasing you. The puzzles were fairly frustrating, I had some trouble with certain bits. There was always something stopping you and you never got all the hints at first which gave the player more to discover. The atmosphere showed clearly how such a game like this should be portrayed. And it shows it realistically. For these events could actually take place in the modern day world. It had graphic scenes which not many horror games actually let you view for instance Amnesia or Slender. The fact that it's at night time (which most horror games are) makes it even more gloomy than what it should be perhaps. The dismembered bodies and the disturbing faces makes the horror game a much more memorable experience, whether you like it or not.Now for the cons: A few things bothered me about this game. Only a few, trust me, there are more pro's than there are cons. I found it rather annoying how the batteries used to charge the camera ran out in a couple minutes or so, only when you're using night vision, thank god. And they had only ever shown up where convienent, not in some random place, only where you'd most need it if you're lucky. And I found it kind of stupid that when you're in a place, hiding from the current antagonists, when they see you, they go in the same route every time, they never mixed it up a little. And I noticed that if you were hiding under a bed in a room which had numerous amount, the game tries to make you heart pump by having them go to the bed beside, in front or behind you. And I found it annoying how they'd always go to the same places when looking for you, it all seemed rather robotical.Finally, this is only my opinion by the way, it isn't the same for a number of people. In my opinion IT WASN'T SCARY! I know what you're thinking now, ""what?! how could he not find it scary? it was scary as     !"" Well my opinion is, it's not scary buddy. I have played the entire game and this is a game which is supposed to be filled with jumpscares, I only jumped ONCE. ONCE. I was kind of amazed myself. It wasn't a game which kept me awake at night thinking about it. It was a game I found exciting to play when I was being searched for or chased after. I bought the game expecting myself to      my pants. Well, that didn't happen. At all. But I didn't like it for the frights, I liked it for the thrill. So here are my pros:1. Thrilling game.2. Gives complex puzzles which you actually have to use your brain to figure out.3. Gives a unique atmosphere which makes the game independent from other games. 4. Has a realistic feel which can make you think if this is possible. 5. Lets players with lower graphic laptops or PC's join in (if you dare).6. Provides challenges which gives you the rush that every horror game needs.And here are my cons:1. Supplies are used to fast.2. Items and information only shows up where convienient. 3. Enemies don't stretch their minds when looking for the player.4. Tries to make you afraid they'll find you, but doesn't exactly succeed. 5. Not scary enough to fill my lust for horror.I recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a fun ride in the horror genre and can handle seeing disturbing images, I would say it's for the people 16 and up. But if you got the guts then 12 and up. So, in the end. My rating out of 10 for this game will be 7.9.Outlast, you give a thrill, not a chill.SusOnMe, signing off.

Played the standalone, should've bought rust instead.My first experience:I spawn at Balota. Nice and happy due to the fact oh yay I can get a gun. I was wrong, too many bandits and shooting near Balota so I decided to go to Cherno and have fun. On the way I found some food and a bag and a helmet. First person I meet is really nice and I talk to him and stuff but the first thing I know he knocks me out and steals my pants and food. Well      that guy. I finally wake up from the 30 minute knock out time which there is no timer to help you and run away. I go down the road and meet another dude who was just punching the air. Talk to him and he is nice, I really don't care if he knocks me out at this point cause I will probably just quit the game rather than wait another 30 minutes. Next thing I know, BOOM two bandits come out with guns aiming down their sights at me and the dude who only have our fists out. They tell us to surrender so I am quickly mashing buttons to try and surrender (first time playing so I had no clue what button) and they decided to hatchet me, knock me out and then leave me for zombies to eat me. I just left. This game legitimately sucks    . But wait, just to be even more awesome don't forget to add the fact the game has no cars, loot is near impossible to find, when you find food you need a sharp object oh and the fact everything is so glitchy it is near impossible to play.I tried getting back into the game but everytime I spawned it was night time, I had a torch but due to DayZ glitching, my torch was facing behind me and I had no way of seeing loot.10/10 reccomend you do not buy this game. Go buy the mod instead, sure it may be an old game but it is sadly much much better than DayZ Standalone will ever be. Oh and add the fact DayZ Standalone probably won't be finished until 3 years time and in 2 years time they finally add cars.",2014-02-01,77,76561197971688382,221100,DayZ,170,0,0

However, it's still one of the most popular and most played games on Steam. Garry's Mod is an endless sandbox game which is a sandbox version of the well and known played game, Half Life 2. This allows the user to interact with many things such as objects, cars, ragdolls, etc. From this, the user is able to create anything, they can build contraptions, boats, vehicles, houses, towers, etc. The possibilities are endless! From my experiences, I have overall spent 3,000+ hours onto this game and I've never gotten bored of it yet, not even a little since not only does Garry's Mod include Sandbox mode, there are many more other modes. Some made by Garry and the rest made by the Garry's Mod Community. In addition, Garry's Mod also includes a workshop which allows people to upload their work of art, new items such as weapons, maps, vehicles, etc. Garry's Mod is mostly made up by the community. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to everybody highly because of the price and the infinite possibilities.And there's the other side.

If you have ""Not Starved"" before in single player imgaine trying to do that while supporting friends at the same time. Another good feature about multiplayer is that multiple characters means mulitple bonuses e.g. Wilson for beard, Wolfgang for damage, Willow for..well..fire. Also the workshop is also included and provides some fun different characters/items to play with. Regarding dying when someone (inevitabley) dies they will become a ghost, this ghost will lower players sanity until revived into a player again using methods such as; touch stone, life giving amulet, meat effigy and after this occurs the player will have less maxium health, but this maxium health can be restored with a booster shoot (which isn't too hard, but not easy to make).

Just like in Mount Your Friends, if it wasn't by the hanging dongs and the nude characters, the game would be totally focused on the competitiviness it has, while in SpeedRunners, the game has a gayish character with a pink unicorn costume, and another character with a big red ball head with a star on it, symbolizing the comunism.The game has a nice plot, by first sight, since it involves all of an hero world where you need to save scientists from bombs.93/100",2015-03-28,176,76561198059611702,207140,SpeedRunners,1479,0,1

For one, all aircraft are 25% less reserch points. It still takes a long time to unloack all aircraft, but at least they're making some effort to balance the progression curve.1.39 has also massively dropped the price of aircraft (and slightly dropped the price of repairs), in some cases aircraft are 1/3 of the lion price they were. Again, a step in the right direction. Original review content is below, most of the bullet points are the same.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As much as I want to, I can't reccomend this game. Gajin seems to have turned it into a money farm. Progression was always a problem in the game. pre patch 1.37 money was a problem. If you wanted to buy all the aircraft of a rank you had to either grind hard or buy premium currency. It was a constant complaint on the forums. Did Gajin listen? nope!Post patch 1.37 the problem is even worse. Money is still an issue, only now you have to research aircraft individually. Other members have done the math on this showing that it slows progression and devalues premium currency by 4-5x. The progression curve is broken. So broken that it's kind of pointless to switch between countries. if you want a jet before your 60th birthday, you grind the hell out of one country until your brain melts.This saddens me. The game itself is wonderfully fun. The way the devs have handled it makes me want to puke. If you do play, play for free.

Enough said - buy it and dive in. If you've never played a Paradox game of this nature before then read on....This game has a steep learning curve, matched only by the joy from the gameplay after you get over the initial hump. My brother showed me the interface and took me through some of the concepts of the game initially which got me over that learning curve. I would recommend watching some kind of Youtube videos or reading up on the game concepts because it doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the terminology of the era.There's a moment when it just starts to click and when it does, it feels like you've opened a door to a whole new world of great gaming. I have spent more time playing this game than any other.I would recommend buying some of the expansion packs for flavour as the big ones have some excellent additions to the Crusader Kings gameplay however to start with, the normal game is great. I have always been a fan of the Total War series. This game is not that. It's not as hands on tactical (regarding battles and such), it's much more strategic in it's approach. It's much more personable. Your character, his or her family, friends, relations, vassals and enemies really MATTER.I have always been a fan of the Civ series. This game is not that. It's a much more in depth dive into the feudal system. Civilisation is a brilliant glimpse at the whole of human history.

It is because of my interest in the intellectual property that I will endure these hiccups because the story that I've only seen 1/6 of so far seems worth it. If you don't have the patience to endure these temporary flaws then I would advise that you wait until after the last episode has been released before getting the game, but if your impatience (like mine) takes the form of needing to know what happens next as soon as     ing possible then those things are in all likelihood going to be (and indeed, so far have been) a big part of the experience. OR you could just go and watch a playthrough on the youtubes but then you would miss out on the experience of actually making decisions (not that they really have any impact on the story in the first episode). This game does so far capture the spirit of its source material, and for that it should receive praise, its marketing genius and i'm eating it the      up. woot",2015-01-11,300,76561198059582003,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,0,0,1

Staring at a huge monitor watching amazing-looking explosions is amazing. The customizablility in this game is actually, compared to other MMOFPSs very enjoyable and all-in-all 'nice'. The 6 classes all have a TON of differences in gameplay and play-style, and this is very different from your generic 'different health and guns' stereotype people usually associate with FPSs. For example, in Planetside 2, the light assault infantry unit has an upgradable jetpack and only 2 weapon slots. Speaking of customisable things, the New Conglomerate, Terran Republic and Vanu Sovereinty differ in play-style. The New Conglomerate uses powerful, high velocity bullets to quickly take down targets and battle at long range over the plains of Amerish, the Terran Republic uses fast firing weapons to fire many bullets into enemies, perfect for the hilly ambush predator riddled landscape of Indar, and the more futuristic Vanu Sovereinty infantry units are equipped with faster reloading laser weapons, perfect with reflex scopes and someone with sharp vision for the long reaching, vast sea beds of Esamir.",2013-12-22,6,76561198059561486,218230,PlanetSide 2,0,0,1

DLC's are really up to you but the gage dlcs are recommended(just to have more weapon choices). I believe that the microtransactions and the safes are being overreacted to. You can always choose to get the skins, or, you can choose not to. The skins itself aren't great and the nice people down at LastBullet have way better mods for weapons (not sponsored). The stat increases are really dumb in theory and in practice, but only stability and concealment are affected. Overall, this is a game that was good when it came out, better with the addition of useful DLC's like Gage Weapons Pack 1 2 and 3, and has begun to fall given the surge of fun but a bit impractical DLCs like Wild West, BBQ and Chivalry. And oh god the Character Packs! It is not worth it to get them all, I got Dragan because I love the Lion's Roar, is complete beast, and Sokol for Grinder.

I've played this since 2011 (Gmod 12) but I don't play it as much anymore but I have to say, for someone my age back then, this game was such a blast and I couldn't stop playing it. I remember booting up singleplayer and then downloading stuff off the Toybox seeing what people have created and uploaded including myself uploading a save of a VW Golf and a Nissan 350z and reading comments; Anyway, then I'd download mods off https://garrysmods.org/ and I'd have to figure out how to install them as a 11-12 year old who was new to installing things haha. I'd even mention this game to friends at school and show my friends if they were over. Also I made an abundance of friends playing this game online. Many laughs and tears. :') I've met lots of great people through it. Looking back at my screenshots off my old computer is always giving me nostalgia of the fun I had.This game gave me lots of joy and I can't thank it enough. And it still does when I load it back up and give it a go nowadays. This game has improved in many ways. I really do recommend this game. It is great fun and you can do whatever you like with it! :) Thanks for reading!

It has both so I can't complain. Steamworld Dig is a great mining game with several influences such as Terarria, Megaman and Metroid. You play as Rusty who has inherited an old mine from his uncle. The main objective is to mine, collect ores, sell them and reach for the bottem of the mine. It was originally released on 3DS and the game is quite appealing to the eye, they managed to add quite a bit of colour for a mining game which is nice. The music is decent but I wouldn't say catchy. It more melds right into the game which is great as it adds to the game. The mining in the game is all about risk versus reward and it is done quite superbly.Overall I give it 8.5/10 Its fun, looks great and you can play the game in your own pace.

Every aspect and potential fun of the game is ruined by glitches and annoyances. How long has the game been delayed now? what the hell have you even done with all this time? added jumpers and hats? not even one vehicle or anything majorly new for that fact, has been released in the standalone. granted this is still an early access game, but this joke of a game has made little to no major progress over the original mod. It is the same bland game with no vehicles, a massive map, undersatisfying rewards and takes a massive amount of time to accumulate everything you need to have a DECENT time. And that is if you don't glitch out or die from stepping through a door. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. I have truly lost hope in the developers, i sincerely hope they bring this game back up to the standards of the arma mod version although it probably is impossible and would take 10 lifetimes. This game is a massive joke and do not waste your time with it, you should just buy arma and use the mod or epoch.

I'll try to be as objective as I can, so you can decide for yourself whether or not it's worth it.If a classic top-down RPG is your goal, by all means, get this. It has all you need to get started - the default build even comes with a main AND pause menu!So, let's play pros and cons:Pros:- Simple to navigate UI- A LOT of pre made stuff to make prototyping quickly- Documentation for the programmers- Reasonable price (when I bought it)- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Some cool stuff in the workshopCons:- It's easy to tell when someone has made a game with this program- Most of the community made graphics conform to the grid of RPG Maker - making most of the stuff look 'generic'- Want to make a turn-based strategy?

He was scared so he ran, John knocked again Silence he called along his trusty pal with an out dated 2k11 C4 and planted it on the decaying door *BANG* Allahu heard the crowd storm into his house creating havoc and looting, Allahu cried clenching his c4 whilst he was wishing he was home, The crowd were done with the loot and house and were looking for him He shreeked as they began dismantling the Iron door Allahu forgot his assault rifle on his table, He was defense was weak they were in allahu chucked the c4 far into the crowd and ran... He ran as fast as he could until he got to the edge of the island and sat down in pain... All his hard work was gone... T'was a tough night for Allahu he couldnt believe what was happening... He had a thought about remaking his life... He shrugged and planted his two feet on the edge of the island.... He looked down. The waves smashing the rocks below......

Note that I said 'cinematic'. Because the story and plot really makes you feel that you're watching a movie, even quick time events are added mid cinematics for more involvement. Don't hear what others say about the glitches. I rarely even see them, only glitching out while gliding at certain times.Gameplay is as refined as ever, brought over from akrham city. And the boss fights, oh the lovely boss fights. Sure, some of it have rehashed movesets from the previous games, but mostly freaking amazing, far better than that arkham tank game (if you know what i mean). Story is interesting and encourages you to finish it, and there are some very emotional moments that i dont want to spoil. Some skins are made free by completing certain objectives which is really appreciated. I really enjoy the overall game as I play this gritty, violent batman who doesn't even bat an eye to break every bone he sees to get what he wants. In short, if you are looking for a batman game set in winter, has awesome boss fights, amazing story, buy this gameright now during its weekend sale. The DLC is also worth it too, unfortunately there are no sale prices for that.",2024-09-16,83,76561198059599439,209000,Batman : Arkham Origins,40,0,1

There's a special feeling of doom when you open a door and your injured hacker gets splattered by a rehacked turret, and you realise that now the rest of your team can't get back to the escape hatch. I'd have preferred a longer, more drawn out game though, 4 missions in a campaign can be done within 2 hours at the most, unless you end up getting your party killed halfway through a lot like me. Party relationships seem to minimally effect the game, and the party banter ends up getting recycled an awful lot.

Although due to the small objects that are included you can't easily 'blend' with the wall. You can, however, easily use the small pieces to do nice leaps from wall to wall to accelerate you.That was only talking about the graphics and skulk though! As the aliens (or Karah) you can evolve into different types; flying, slashing, 'tank' and (the cute) support, allowing you to also evolve to the new types, each set with separate abilities.The marines look like they have it tough but in fact they do not as the marines being equip with an arsenal of ranged weapons, along with jet-packs, allow them to dodge attacks and kill something before it get to them...usually.It may seem that the game has a variation of 2 gametypes to play; fast and 'abusive' or slow and stealthy, but there is also a third variation. The commander! Without the comm (commander) you will be screwed, and without a good comm you will also be screwed, as a comm on either team are required to be able to place support structures and upgrade you. This means that if you are more of a good strategy, top down, player then you don't have to go looking for another game, honestly its like 2 games in one!There's one major floor with some of the levels though; some are too wide. This makes it nearly impossible for the Karah to win. There are some rooms where the moment the marines capture it, the karah aren't able to even enter the room, as they are to wide open. There is also glitches in the maps that stop the comm from placing connection nodes called ""cysts"", these cysts are the Karah's way of 'transferring energy', where you are meant to be able to. An annoyance is that sometimes you will get base rushed and that's the end of the game...no joke, once your base is attacked within the first 15 minutes you are placed in a permanent disadvantage. This problem is in many games, though, and can not be solved by devs. So nearly every player on this game has a mutual understanding not to EGBR (Early Game Base Rush) so it is currently quite rare to see a base rush within 15 minutes or so of a match starting.Another major problem is the difficulty curve. Due to the fact that there is practically no training, trying to understand how to play properly and learn how to 'dodge bullets' is simply not possible. The training in the game is mostly just a movement tutorial as the bots are very...unresponsive. Although there is a video tutorial which helps when trying to understand the games mechanics.In total NS2 is well balanced and if you stick with the game long enough it, will end up being incredibly fun. It only takes about 1 hour to fully understand the game... well for me it did.I almost forgot to mention the loading times take about 5-10 minutes....graphics: ++extremely smooth controls:+++multi-genre:++teams are nothing like each other:+++acceleration physics used as mechanic:++original character variety:++proper stealth mechanics:++character traits stay for only that character type:+MODDING SUPPORT:+bias maps:-map glitches:--EGBR problem:-anti EGBR community (mostly):+difficulty/learning curve: --training/practice mode:+helpful tutorial:++bad bot AI:-loading times:-scoring:22 pros8 constotal: 14 prosn=number of cons/pros totala=answer+/- depends on cons majority (-) or pros majority (+)0.16666666666666666666666666666667*n=a +/- 50.16666666666666666666666666666667*14=2.33334+5=7.3/10",2014-06-16,300,76561198059582003,4920,Natural Selection 2,653,0,1

20169,rpg,Champions Online,2009-09-01,-1.0,9880,Cryptic Studios,2009,altoryu,9880,"I have some praises for this game but for those who are looking for a good f2p experience, this is almost definitely not your game.So I'm gonna make this clear here and now.You are probably not going to have much fun with this game unless you sink some money into it since its where most of the content lies. Champions Online is an MMO with a superhero theme to it if it was not obvious enough. I started playing this way back in the day probably as early as 2011 though I didn't really seriously pick it up until maybe around 2013. I played for a while and unlocked one of the 'gold' archtypes with real money. I played, made a character, tried to make a story and such out of it since the game seems to encourage you to do that with the nemesis system and all.But again most of fun doesn't really happen until you either unlock a freeform slot with money separately or you get a gold sub for the game which you can do on different terms like monthly and yearly from memory or you can do what I did and dig in for the lifetime sub that lasts until the game inevitably shuts down.Doing this allow you to access freeform slots which are basically slots in which you can customise every aspect of your character from primary and secondary main stats, powers and skill trees, This is where most of the fun can come into it since you can make the character how you want it instead of having to follow a set skill system but unfortunate it is behind a paywall.That said though from the last time I played it, the game is pretty dead, there are people around yes but maybe 4-500 tops on good days. The end content is kind of dull as well getting your usual dailies and such though there are special 'comic' missions that are basically mini campaigns separate from the main story. Rampages are where you will probably spend most of your time when you get to max level (which is 40 btw) cause it's where you need to farm the materials for the best equipment in the game. Drop rates are pretty bad so you are going to have to grind for quite a while to get anything to drop for you and even then you need like 6 of each item (add there are about 3-4 different rampage items) in order to make a full set of armour and if you have multiple characters, be ready for the long grind.The game is also microtransactions galore from costume sets to powers to 'lockboxes' which are boxes you need to open with keys that cost 100 Zen a piece which is the premium currency for the game in order to unlock special costumes and vehicles that only come from those lockboxes, or just wait until they turn up in the auction house for a pretty penny (ie stupidity expensive cause price gouging is popular with players in the game).However all of that I did ignore cause if there is one praise I have for thise game it's the pretty robust character creation system where you can select from a ton of different options (a lot are premium parts but once unlocked they are unlocked amongst all character and future ones on your account). You can be an undead superhero, a mad scientist, an Iron Man wannabe, or if you are me, create a tiger that kicks     with martial arts or uses firearms to blow away minions.Story is pretty bland in a lot of places and some of the voice acting/lip and body animations will leave you cringing as you meet characters that are pretty clear ripoffs of superheroes like Iron Man, The Flash and organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D.Do I recommend this game? If you have the cash you are willing to input into the game for a gold sub then maybe yes but this game has a lot of things that needs fixing before it's close to anything mainstream. However if you can look past that, you can really get lost in the character creation system, creating many different heroes with varying powers from fire to poison to demonic powers to kinetic force.",2015-09-23,31,76561198059706108,9880,Champions Online,6,0,0

The ability to fly, ride bikes, drive tanks-Jeeps-and APC's in a WW2 setting is just great. You start off as a basic infantry soldier and from there, once at the right rank, can transfer to different classes (with a certain amount of in-game credits depending on the class) such as the pilot, recon, tank crewman and paratrooper (keeping in mind you can always change back to the infantry man). You unlock many weapons while playing and these include MG's, SMG's, Sniper rifles, Bolt Actions, Rocket Launchers, Anti-tank grenades/mines, Anti-personnel mines, Pistols and heaps more. You are also free to mod most guns for in-game credits. You also unlock many vehicles depending on the type of soldier you are. As a tank crewman, you unlock different tanks. As a recon, you can unlock motorbikes and Infantry Fighting Vehicles. As a pilot you (by default) get an aircraft. As a paratrooper you can't unlock any vehicles so far.  As infantry, you can unlock Jeeps, motorbikes and Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC's). These vehicles, if well driven, can be as fast as Sanic hte Hedjhag (500 fasts/h). You also earn ribbons for doing certain things such as capturing outposts, killing people using certain weapons, destroying enemy tanks with your tank, driving vehicles and so much more. With these ribbons, you can unlock heaps of things including weapons and vehicles.

Firstly, the gameplay is fluent when you need it to be, (in epic, drop assassinations and a quick escape) and dramatic and well-paced when it needs to be (when you're planning how to slink around Dunwall, or dodging guards like the badass you know you are). While the game focuses a lot on its polished stealth mechanics, violent, overt styles are generally ""frowned upon"" and the player may feel especially persuaded to put down the ever-so-loud pistol and swap back to the good ol' fashioned blade and blink the game wants you to use. But in saying this, I wouldn't precisely call this a negative.The good thing about Dishonored is that you can play it again and again and try a different style everytime. I've played through it about 4 times now and even then I realize that there is so much more I can be doing. Don't like the stealthy style? Want a bit of a challenge? Flip the system the bird and run in, guns blazing and rats swarming. Feeling edgy? Want to be the dark and mysterious character you know you can be? Equip your dark vision and crossbow and slink around like an actual assassin.The plot is predictable, but you'll easily see past that when you immerse yourself in the lore rich world of Dunwall. Littered like candy wrappers at a park, you'll find all sorts of books, clippings and conversations  that hint and tease at the world of Dunwall. Drunken sailor chants tell you of the dark and violent histories of the City, intelligent scriptures of scholarly standard describe the mysterious Outsider and small talk between the servants of mansions will tell you of the current affairs, generally murder, plague and poverty.And you can't leave out the confronting and generally awesome artwork and landscape. Brilliantly crafted, Dishonoured's graphics do well at setting a dark and gloomy mood that brings a fantastic view to the Steampunk genre. Tall, crooked buildings, decorated in pipes, cogs and other steampunk personifications make Dunwall so lovable and real. Hound Pits Pub flyers hang like dead bodies from notice boards, weathered walkways are tainted with putrid rats and corpses, homes are only made warm by the people inside as they lack food and security. Overall, buy this game, play it 6-7 times and immerse yourself in the stunning world of Arkane Studio's Dishonored.",2015-05-17,121,76561198059566639,205100,Dishonored,0,0,1

Nearly everything about this game makes it a must-buy, from the low selling price to its replayability. This game is amazing, even if you do not like dungeon crawlers. Difficulty is perfectly appropriate and challenging and the character design and art is top-notch. It's quite disturbing but it fits the mood perfectly. The possible downsides to the game lie within how it is coded. Sadly, the game runs on Flash, ruling out use of the Steam overlay UI as well as lack of proper screen resolution support.

The story for the most part is hard to follow if you dont pay attention and because there is no dialogue it isn't dropped in sort of easy to pick up hints. Instead when you talk to people you are shown still images that tell a short tale. From what I can tell the story is ""You're part of a race called Blue-Skins, who did some bad      and are hated. You are approached by Anubis/The Jackal who is supposed to be god, he asks your help to fight an evil called Judgement, the Jackal makes sure you do this by giving you a disease that will kill you unless you help him seek out and destroy Judgement!""Tl:dr You're a smurf who needs to help a dog god kill a big black thing, also you've got cancer.The game itself has a lot of big pro's and con's that will likely affect your decision on buying itPro-Amazing art style-Amazing music-Difficult gameplay-NG+-No dialogue-Pretty cheap price when on sale-A few difficult achievments to work towards-Makes you want more high quality gamesCon -No Dialogue-Sometimes unfair and a bit frustrating-Only one story or way to play the story-Pretty short game-Makes you want more high quality games-Capped at 30 fpsSo I put some stuff in both Pro and Con, I doubt I have to explain why but I will just in case.Stuff like no dialogue are both good and bad, depends on the point of view.Anyway my final review of this is  8/10 Gameplay  6/10 story 3/10 replayability  7/10 Overall  Like Dark souls and Zelda violently     ing behind a bar ",2024-07-04,113,76561198060067718,257850,Hyper Light Drifter,727,0,1

Apart from this, I do find the game fun to play especially with friends or a team. Food and supplies are scarce so it is quite challenging to scour the land to find such things. Massive map so far that could even expand a lot larger. I'd have to say 50/50 with this game.

It may seem tough and unforgiving when you first play it, but the more you play it and the more you learn, the more you will enjoy it! This game doesn't hold your hand the whole way through which isn't a bad thing. One bad thing about this game though is that the tutorials make absolutely no sense and doesn't really help at all. This game will make you manage a colony of people, while dealing with things like starvation and monsters. It is by no means an easy game, but if your up for a challange, then I really must recommend this game because, even though it is not perfect, it is still entertaining. I give it a 6/10."" -Snubbo 2014Well, I see that my oppinions have greatly changed. This was the period when I was engrossed in this game. Let's just say that I no longer find any enjoyment out of this. This is a game with tutorials that are about as easy to understand and Astro Physics, the difficulty curve makes it really hard for newcomers and really annoying for anyone else. In this game you build a town, get people to move in, manage the food, water, ect. Eventually you may even get a warrior to move in. The problem is keeping your people alive, with the management system not quite working, which is a big problem in a game that is all about managing. Here is an example...You set some of you villagers to start picking apples, drop them off, and then cook them into pies. You then get the rest of your crew to go mining, with the help of some warriors. After about 20 seconds the warriors decide to wander off, 2 of the 5 you had get themselves killed, on the way to the apple and pear trees your villagers manage to drown themselves, the rest come up from mining to find no food and then die from starvation on the way to pick apples.The result is a game that doesn't want you to enjoy it too much.

Comparing this to ETS2, I would say that this game has several improvements in terms of gameplay. One of which is the new trailer parking options. I find it very pleasing to be able to choose how you would like to park the trailer.The trucks themselves are quite different from the trucks in ETS. The trucks in this game have long bonnets, and I find it rather difficult to turn since I am used to the bonnet-less European trucks from ETS.Moving on to the map. The map in this game is still small compared to the map in ETS2. Currently, the game only has 2 states in its map.Overall, however, I think that this game is very enjoyable to play, and I find it relaxing to play this game, especially while listening to music.",2024-02-04,270,76561197985239253,270880,American Truck Simulator,489,0,1

It's really good how you can travel to other planets and useful, because you might've took nearly all the ores out of the world, so you just go to a different planet! Also, it's scientific, like if you keep on heading up, eventually you will enter space and find a meteorite! The soundtracks are just amazing... There is also dungeons, Asteroid fields, villages and heaps of biomes. One of my favourite things about Starbound is the tech. Tech is you can say almost a power you acquire. There's heaps of them and I reckon bubble boost and butterfly boost is the best. So get Starbound right now and don't wait to get it! As I strongly recommend it.

I'm just going to get that out the way first up since I don't really know how to review this without spoiling EVERYTHING. And this is a game that NEEDS to be played blind. With all the jokes and story points it will not be as great of an experience if ANYTHING is spoiled for you, except for the secrets, maybe. Alright. Time for the ACTUAL review. Let's start with the soundtrack, since it can be described in one word: PERFECTHonestly, this is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. I love the use of both chiptune and real (recorded samples, maybe) instruments. Every song is superb and has its own place. If you were to ask me what my favourite track from the game is, I wouldn't be able to tell you. The graphics are very nice, reminiscent of consoles such as the Commodore 64 all the way to the Game Boy Advanced (Skipping one or two), and something else... (Not telling because it would spoil it, somewhat). They don't add or subtract anything (Except one part. You'll know what it is) but were worth mentioning anyway.The story has got to be the defining factor for this game. Without as great a story as this, the game would probably be a ""good"" instead of ""OMG IT'S THE BEST GAME EVER"" (Sorry). It isn't one of those games where the story is incredibly rich at the very beginning. It actually starts with a very small story that could be put into a 1980s NES game. However, the more you play, the more you explore and the more you want to find, you more you will find. There are just so many details that all correlate with each other. I can't really say anymore without spoiling some of the game, so you'll just have to trust me on this one. The gameplay is quite fun as well. Instead of having turns that bounce back between the player and the opponent, like a traditional JRPG, The player attacks with a simple QTE and dodges the enemy attacks like a Shoot em up. It's a very interesting and fun twist on the old way of battling. Undertale is easily my Game of the Year and possibly my favourite game EVER. (It's still contending with Terraria for the number one spot). Even though it isn't a game you can play over and over and over again, the quality of this game absolutely outstanding. So good job Toby Fox for making this brilliant game, and making me spend half an hour on a review. Final Score - 10.000000001/10(Someone will get that)TL;DR: IS BEST GAME GO BUY NOW!",2015-12-04,31,76561198059626201,391540,Undertale,249,0,1

Sins of a Solar Empire is brilliant. 9/10The gameplay mechanics do take experience to master, but that's all part of what makes the game so wonderful; there are so many aspects of gameplay to take into consideration when you are in a match, such as culture, research topics, and etcetera. If you think that all you have to do to prevail in a match of Sins is to build a thousand ships and spam orbital cannons, you are sorely mistaken.One thing that appeals to me personally about Sins is the fact that, right from the beginning, you have to meticulously plan out each detail of your empire's expansion, taking into consideration events that could potentially happen hours later.That planet with only one phase lane leading into enemy territory? Chances are your enemy will eventually try to punch through. You'll need to plan for that. The world on the other side of the map that's just starting to produce culture? It will spread to your planets quickly. You'll need to plan for that.That TEC Loyalist player on the other side of the map whose planet pings up for a second with a superweapon alert? You'll especially need to plan for that.The one and only downside for me about Sins is, and I'm sure this is a common one, there's no campaign! The franchise has gone into a good deal of detail creating a backstory, seriously, there's a whole bunch of story content out there. What I would really like to see is an actual in-game campaign in which you can follow one of the three main empires on their quests within this storyline. Another little want of mine is to have a campaign constructor. That would be amazing. If these things were there, a 10/10 game.It's pretty much impossible to get bored of Sins, each game turns out differently from the last. But if, however, you somehow manage to get bored, there's but one thing for that: mods. This game has a Star Trek mod, and subsequently has my seal of approval.This game is amazing. I myself have had endless hours of fun with Sins, and reccommend this entirely to everybody.

Still a decent game though. Just buy the game and DLCs during a sale to actually play the game without spending a lot of money.*EDITSince Update 100 came out and microtransactions were removed, the game is now going back to its roots. Overkill listened to the community and that the next generation of safes will be completely free, except for the old gen. You'll still need to use a drill to open them. The revamped skill trees introduced by Update 100 have changed the way you play the game, in my experience at least. Some skills were nerfed (Inspire) others were buffed (Sentry Guns) and some were merged with other skills. In a way, this new system allows more roleplay and tactics during heists. Oh, and the update made Akimbos and the Saw to be usable by default which should have been in the game from the start. Anyway, Overkill also announced that they now own all the rights to the Payday franchise. Which means that they'll support the game throughout this year to the end of 2017. I don't know what'll happen to the game at this point. Overkill gained most of their fans back and they support them in return. So I guess that the game will survive after all.",2024-05-17,121,76561198059566639,218620,PAYDAY 2,209,0,1

The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it's gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I'd give it a 9/10.

The Paris mission is huge and would not have been out of place amongst the latter levels of Blood Money.Improved disguise system. The disguises aren't as ridiculously nerfed as in Absolution, but neither are they as OP as they are in Blood Money. Now only a few particularly perceptive people will be able to see through your disguises if you stay in their line of sight for too long. This brings the focus of the game's stealth back to hiding in plain sight, rather than sneaking in the shadows Choosing loadouts. You can choose your weapons and clothing at the start of missions again, although it seems that they haven't returned to the weapon customisation that was present in Blood Money.Great replayability. There is a large variety of ways in which you can assassinate your targets. Each level is full of unique accidents waiting to happen. There are also a number of challenges on each level that encourage exploration of both the map and methods of assassination. Completing these challenges contributes to the 'mastery rank' of the mission, which allows you to unlock things such as new starting areas and agency stashes on the map.ConsRuns like    . The game has some serious performance issues. Expect to turn down graphics quite a bit. Having said that, the game still holds up visually, even on low settings.Always online. It is possible to play offline, but if you are in the middle of an online session and your connection cuts out for whatever reason then you will be pulled out into the main menu and any unsaved progress will be lost. This has happened to me once so far.'Opportunities'. This can be toggled off in the menu (thank god) which I highly recommend you do. This new feature lays out explicitly all the unique ways in which you can eliminate your target. A big bulk of this game comes from exploring the level and scoping out opportunities for yourself, so turning this option off is a must.Episodic.

You are instantly immersed through the rich and soft textures and the angelic lighting that is the beauty of the oil painting styled, floating city of Columbia. Your immersion only deepens upon hearing the game's soundtrack, the wonderful voice acting and the lively and interactive enrionment that surrounds you. The immersion sits the player down, orientates and plunges them into an incredibly rich story that discusse an alternate realm of 20th century America, in which post-moderinism has sky-rocketed however the scientific marvels are under the control of ""the Prophet"", who preaches a religion very similar to Christianity. Through his dominion over Columbia he his created corruption in the city and a severe class division, also, he keeps his daughter locked away in a tower that overlooks the city. As Booker Dewitt, you are tasked to rescue the girl from the tower and return her to New York to pay your debts. However, the story goes above and beyond your original plans and transform into a materfully crafted journey into self-discovery and the liberation of a religously/poltically opressed city. What makes this story so rich and immersive is it's use of  quantam physics' String Theory, as a key plot structure. String Theory explores the fundamental forces in the world, the consquences of hidden dimensions, number of dimensions and the supersymmetry between dimensions. Needless to say the context, the plot, the graphics, the themes, and the gameplay will leave you breathless.The Burial At Sea DLC is also incredible.

It is in early alpha and it is hard to say whether I think it is worth waiting or picking up now.I personally find the game pretty fun and entertaining, but that is just my competitive side talking. The community is going to be a rough one. Lot of games with this ""Kill or be killed"" mentality often have a horrible community starting out. Lot of people want to kill you because they are curious what you have and want to take it from you. It definitely brings the savages out in the world lol.I think, if you played DayZ, Minecraft and any other survival type game, you may like this game very much, but if the kill or be killed mentality is not for you.. then I would not recommend it. They have non PVP servers, so it may be an option, but majority are PVP.I really think the game needs a way to encourage people to work together, rather than get greedy and become savage bandits. But do so in a way, that does not affect the players negatively. I often like roleplaying with these kind of games, but due to the people out for blood, it makes the roleplay very difficult or impossible.

(one click button attack, hold to do power attack) There is a fair few weapons to come across from the mighty code hammer to the speedy coffee mug. There's also some pretty cool easter eggs from some of my favorite movies and games that i won't spoil.There is a really decent amount of different monsters to encounter too, from bats, annoying as hell goblins and slimes to minotaurs, cyclopes, Succubs and the crazy OP lich king. The randomization of this game is really well done too, it actually feels like luck based randomization unlike other rouge-likes/lites which you are more or less guaranteed to get better loot straight after spawn.

You can still spend money, but it all goes to cosmetics, so the only factor that differs between players is their skill level.Just a quick thing, the community. The community in csgo is massive, and of course it has its ups and downs. All communities have toxic players, hackers, scammers etc, as well as helpers and friendly players. But the one thing that strikes me about this game, is that the devs gave it to us, and we figured it out from there. We discovered bhopping, trading techniques and heaps of other stuff, and that is what really strikes me about this game, its that we as a community, figured this game out for ourselves, and even found some things that the devs didnt.Third, the skins. Now personally I dont see why you would spend hundreds of dollars on an item with no beneficial value whatsoever, but thats just me. But apart from that, the skins are actually a way of making money if you know how to trade. You can go from bloody 4 cent skins to a 100 dollar knife without spending a single cent on the way!

Nothing needs to be changed the way it is now except for a few buggy bits here and there, only thing i would like to see is more unique content (factions/races/alien race?), more units, more maps with up to 8 player and bigger maps.

Maybe not EVERYONE likes this game but, the amount of DETAIL put into this game is just, amazing.The game is about running a prison, and it sticks by it, your prison is in your hands, BUT, my favorite part, is that it's not FULLY in your control. Sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal, but VERY effective tools to placify an inmate. But even with that, you will always get TERRIFIED if one prisoner starts rioting, and they take out a weapon, the guards can fight them, but they attack OTHER inmates, then its the matter of getting a guard ASAP to the area, or risk a life or 2, and recently, when the ability to FAIL was added, suddenly you couldn't let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long, which made it MORE intense when a riot broke out.The developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen, they never get off track with other ideas, as explained in one of their videos, but, they take ideas from all the players, and get the community and, are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameAs mentioned before, not every person may like this game, partly because of the amount of patience needed, but, i dont care, in my opinion, also, the freedom of the modding community is perfectThis game, takes the idea of running a prison, and strategy, and mashes it up into one game, would i reccomend it, OF COURSE, i have put hours, not only building my OWN prison, but downloading others, huge riots, fires, and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45!You dont have to, but to sum all of this up in 3 words, they would be: BUY THIS GAME",2014-07-01,300,76561198059582003,233450,Prison Architect,963,0,1

Released in August 2013, the game sees you and up to three other players tackle a wide variety of heists, robberies, and other assorted criminal activities. You can plan with your team, case the joint, and then try and pull off the score without a hitch. Or, you can end up defending against waves of police if something goes wrong and you have to rely on Plan B. Missions range from simple bank heists or jewel store robberies to more elaborate plans, such as cooking a batch of meth in order to sell to a street gang while under assault from the police. Since the game's initial release in 2013, a number of changes have been made, including reworks to the game's soundtrack and stealth system, among other things. Extra heists and other content have been added too - some free in updates, and some as paid DLC. If you still want to play DLC heists though, you needn't worry about being locked out of content. Even if you don't own a DLC, you can still join a lobby hosting a DLC map. Only buy DLC heists if you plan on hosting your own games for them.As for the game's mechanics themselves, they are very fun and gratifying. Most of the game's heists can be completed without raising the alarm, if you're skilled enough. To do so, you'll have to eliminate guards and make sure to answer their pagers after, though you only have a limit of four until the operator gets too suspicious. Careful management of civilians is also key to keeping your robbery quiet. Tie them down, or they may get brave and phone the police. That's not to say that going guns blazing isn't fun either, though. In fact it's quite the opposite. The game's shooting mechanics are fast, responsive, and smooth, making it easy to gun down hordes of SWAT troopers while also making it a blast to do so. There are a wide variety of weapons to choose from too, so there is something for almost any style of play. Overall, PAYDAY 2 is one of the stronger co-op focused shooters out there. Working as a team to pull off a good score is always fun and rewarding, and the varied heists (with some features, such as the location of security rooms, randomly generated) mean that you won't get bored quickly. The main downside is the lack of a decent single-player experience. While you can play by yourself, you are simply restricted to playing each heist with two AI partners, who aren't smart and can only really function as bullet sponges. So, if you're looking to find a crew (or already have one), then definitely pick this up. If you prefer to play alone, however, this is not the game for you.",2015-01-17,121,76561198059566639,218620,PAYDAY 2,209,0,1

Each side quest somehow feels intertwinned to the main story, which is great because it never feels like it's wasting your time. The upgrading system is quite excellent, although it is possible to become over-powered very quickly, if you choose to focus on one skill set, e.g Might, where you can hack a troll to death in a few swings. The combat is satisfying. Not too fast or too slow, and in most cases you can't just button mash. You must use a variety of weapons, magic and techniques to overwhelm your foe.

Not about the winning for me - its about the fun factor and if you can get a lot from that from this game.  Server browser and creator needs work. The developers really need to think about having a server that can be left on and rotate through maps.  clicking ready and      is a pita.. I understand that having someone join a race midway is a stupid idea, so that needs to be mitigated but the servers should be allowed to have timers for hosts to leave their servers on, have map rotations and also have the ability to manually change the current map without having to disconnect everyone.. also the host leave should revert another avaiable on the net machine to host the game in progress.   other than this the actual game play is a winner. everything is destructable (well 90%) and that equates to a lot of mayhem.  top job. can't wait for more development efforts as if this is what it starts off with I can't wait to see what you do next.",2014-10-24,127,76561198059687929,228380,Next Car Game: Wreckfest,44,0,1

I regret that).This really shows - many Ubisoft games that used lisenced franchises like Disney or other big names at the time often had significanly lower quality in-comparison to their own IP's while also putting a 'spin' on whatever popular game mechanics were being used for these 'outsourced' titles (I.e. a Donald Duck themed Crash Bandicoot with a modified health system ran poorly and is easily beaten by the 3D Rayman titles).Ubisoft's 'spin' this time is the momentum of your movement being mixed with Worms (tm) weapons to create a clunky puzzle game that has the main difficulty being setting up your 'answer' to the challenges that it provides instead of the actual puzzles themselves.Also, Worms games don't even allow users to move when aiming - it feels counter-intuitive to the original franchise too.Not reccommended unless the clunky-2000's style appeals to your rose-tinted nostalgia glasses.",2024-03-05,300,76561198059582003,70650,Worms Blast,0,0,0

Interactive Entertainment. Set one year after the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman Arkham City, the game's main storyline follows Batman as he confronts the Scarecrow, who has launched an attack on Gotham City, causing a city-wide evacuation. Aided by the mysterious Arkham Knight, the Scarecrow unites Batman's greatest foes in a plot to finally kill the Dark Knight. Batman Arkham Knight is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in both combat and exploration. Batman: Arkham Knight now introduces Batman's car, the Batmobile, as a driveable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the your location at your will while on foot, or, if airborne, the car can now be sent to meet Batman just as he lands, it can also be used for combat against the Arkham Knight's tanks or just for transportation around Gotham City. Batman: Arkham Knight is set within Gotham City, which is open for you from the beginning of the game allowing you to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. Many of the gadgets and lots of gameplay elements from the previous Arkham games have returned, including the grapnel gun, line launcher, batarangs, a countering system and the detective vision, which is like Batman's own version of Eagle vision. Changes to the combat system include the ability to now combine attacks on prone enemies without interrupting the streak. Batman can now counter enemy attacks and throw them into other enemies for increased damage. Overall I would say that Batman: Arkham Knight is definitely a step up from previous games, yes the game has a terrible optimization and quite a lot of FPS issues, but the story and gameplay are just fantastic, I really think the Batmobile is definitely a nice new feature of the game. I recommend getting this game when it has been fixed, it is not really that playable at the moment. I would give this game a rating of 8/10 it's absolutely fantastic, I am just absolutely 100% sure without even a single doubt that Batman: Arkham Knight will just blow away all your expectations!!.",2015-06-24,105,76561198059749348,208650,Batman : Arkham Knight,2069,0,1

Customization of your gear makes each fight unique too. From a super stealth gear like the bow, to an extreme killer like the AMR, there is barely anything to make thsi game better. Another addition to the game is the scene. Beautiful islands, waterfalls, mountains, it's really does give you the feeling of you being on a tropical island!

Usually an instant thumb down!BUT, For me the issue was fixed simply by finding the game .exe file (\Steam\steamapps\common\Industry Giant 2)  and then setting the Compatibility Mode to Win Xp Sp3. By doing this the game loads just fine and it loads in 1080!!The only other Compatibilty mode it loaded for me was in Win95 but I couldnt change the resolution at all because it just crashed.So, IF you have the game and it wont load, try what I posted and see if it works.

My main problem is that the earthworm monster would eat trees which is ridiculous, as worms dont even live in trees, so why would they be eating them. I would also likee to know why I cannot build solar farms on the eay map as this would have sped up my game play time quite a bit. Lastly the fact that I recived a D- for my wonderful green powered production of my $1,000,000 makes me think that this game was developed by fatcats who don't understand the complexity of long term damage to ecosystems as a result of fossil fuels, and do not factor in the detrimental eeffects of green power either. Windfarms produce a lot of noise as is highlighted in the more graphically developed, but similar game, Cities Skylines. Unlike Evopollution, within Cities Skyliens you can also build houses so that the power you are producing goes to use instead of just sitting there doing nothing in these giant battery buildings, which somehow produce no waste.I would give this game a 4/10 as it is on the right track to being a good game, but is just missing those crucial elements of interesting gameplay and click to play dialogue with the characters within. I would love to converse with the earthworm and understand what I can do to help him, since he is so hungry that he's eating my windfarms and trees. He clearly has some sort of body image issues as only his head and neck come out of the ground.

It improved and improved as time goes on and has shown me this game is worth keeping.The game is very simple, you are either a Terrorist or a Counter Terrorist.The goal of the Terrorist. To plant the bomb at the selected sites A or B or defend the hostages from  being rescued by the CTAnd the Goal for Counter Terrorist. Defend the bomb sites and rescue the hostages But thats the main gamemode people play which is called Casual. There are many gamemode to choose from in this version of counter strike. The gamemodes other than Casual isDemolition, Competitive and Death MatchGoals for each gamemodeDemolition:  is where you start with one gun and per every kill you get you rank up to the other gun and the goal is to the end of the game is to get the Golden knifeCompetitive: Similar to Casual but stricter, the game is based  on a 5v5 startign with little money and a game that can go to 90 mins. The reason is that it is 30 rounds and the first to 16 wins and 15 being match point.  at 15 rounds the team will swap and the maps are up to you to decide what you want. So for example you just want dust 2 you can just tick dust 2 in your pick of the maps. Team killing is allowed in this gamemode so be careful when u shoot. In competitive you cannot free cam as you can only spectate your team mates and your self for a little bit after you die. The match making is based on your skill level. Unranked is the lowest and the highest is Global elite but dont worry, what rank you are is the systems way of matching players to you Death Match: Death Match is usually the game mode where you practice for competitive because aim is vital in this game. Death Match gives you the option of picking what gun youw want and what Pistol you want to practice agaisnt other players. There is a point system where guns earn you points and guns being selected as random to give you more points if you do get a kill with it.There are many reason why Counter Strike Global Offesnive  differs to other first person shooters. 1 it is constantly being updated, what differs from most fps that they dont usually tweak the game that much but in CS:GO they update regularly. 2.  its a packaged deal, you just buy it and you got everything you need without DLC execpt for gun skins to change the appearance and missions are for ways to complete tasks for a reward of a skin or case in the end. 3 Its cheap. CS GO is very cheap in comparing from the other  main fps titles like Call of Duty, Battlefield etcIn CS GO theres also  some things that most FPS dont havein cs go you have set money and you can earn  through kills and winning rounds to buy better guns in the game either being more accurate or have more damage. Health is also something different most fps's dont have. For example if you are shot in the game you lose health and regenerate like most Fps's right? Wrong, in CS:GO you have a set health with armour to back you up  but if you are shot in the round  you cannot get back the health until the next round.  Hope you love this game more than I and will be fun to see you in CS:GO",2015-01-03,29,76561198059555148,730,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2333,0,1

I'd definitely recommend this to anyone but there are a few bad things about the game too.First of all the driving, and I can't stress enough how horrible it is. I love racing games and I play everything from Dirt 3 to Need for Speed to Grid, and I can tell you, the driving is not nice, and I don't enjoy it one bit. When you steer left or right it feels delayed, and the worst thing of all is this feeling of steering where you either steer barely at all, or any more than that and you completely swerve left or right. I tried using an xbox controller and it didn't feel any better.Next is the repetitiveness. Sure the world is big and there is a lot of bases and towns and all that, but everything is the same. All the military bases have the same stuff to destroy, and I can imagine I will get sick of destroying bases pretty soon. The towns you have to destroy are even worse, and there is no difference between towns, they all have basically the same set of goals to finish taking back the town. Only reason I wanna do all the towns and military bases is to unlock mods. Apart from these two things, I think it's a great game. The second thing about the repetitiveness in the game can't really be fixed, but the driving can be with an update and PLEASE PLEASE update the driving so I actually want to drive a car.Best thing in the game is the wingsuit/grapple/skydive system, fun to move around in and is a wonderful way to get around the world.Also people with performance issues if you're wondering I am running ultra @1080P 70-90fps with a GTX 970, 8GB Mem, and an i5-4570.",2015-12-04,41,76561198059739464,225540,Just Cause 3,19156,41,1

I work in hospitality so it is satisfying to assign players roles and watch everyone work together as a well oiled machine. Only critisism would be that local co-op only limits play time when you don't have a couple of friends to play with. This is not a loss for the game, however it limits the amount of time I will play it. I would also say that there are some frustrating quirks in the game such as food getting stuck on corners of benches and plates getting fused into the sink.

Quem se lembra do game dos meados dos anos 2000 vai se sentir em casa.   divertido relembrar mapas como Dust, Italy e Train e d  at  uma vontade de chamar os amigos para jogar em casa.Mesmo assim,   um jogo que mostra sinais da idade: n o foram feitas atualiza  es nem adicionadas novas mec nicas que justifiquem voltar ao game que, em sua ess ncia,   o mesmo de anos atr s. Vale para quem est  com saudades e quer variar um pouco da mesmice de jogar  Call of Duty .  Pontos Positivos  Mec nica continua atual:N o h  como negar:  Counter-Strike    um jogo extremamente viciante. Mesmo quem se afastou do game - seja pelo motivo que for -, vai se sentir em casa. Afinal, pouco da mec nica foi alterado e o que mudou foi para deixar o game mais realista.Um desses exemplos   quando voc  usa o telesc pio dos rifles de precis o, que deixa a tela um pouco emba ada quando o personagem se move.Mas h  novidades tamb m, como a interface de compra, que agora   circular - o que facilita e muito a navega  o nas vers es para consoles. Novas granadas tamb m aparecem, como o coquetel molotov, que d  liberdade para criar estrat gias diferentes. No final das contas, a mec nica de comprar armas em todos os rounds favorece quem joga com cautela e estrategicamente.A vers o de PlayStation 3 tem ainda suporte para jogar com teclado e mouse, al m do controles de PS Move. J  no X360 n o existem tantas varia  es de controle (nem suporte ao Kinect) e o modo de chat em grupo   desativado   afinal isso poderia ser usado para trapa as, e  Counter-Strike    um jogo que leva muito a s rio a competitividade.Novos modos de jogo Global Offensive  traz dois modos novos: o Arms Race e o Demolition. Mesmo sendo bem distintos, ambos compartilham de um descontra do esp rito arcade e favorecem o confronto direto.Em Arms Race, o jogador ganha novas armas ao matar um advers rio e passa por todas at  chegar ao momento que se v  for ado a usar apenas a faca. S o 26 armas no total e vence quem conseguir usar todas elas com sucesso ou quando o tempo se esgotar.J  em Demolition o esquema   o mesmo das miss es de explos o, mas em cen rios menores e com mais contato entre os times.  Al m disso, o jogador s  usa novas armas quando mata algu m do time advers rio.Em todo caso, essas novas modalidades garantem um f lego extra para quem   veterano e divers o imediata para quem ainda engatinha no game de tiro da Valve.Visual bonito""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive""   muito bonito.   at  estranho dizer isso, tendo em vista que a Source Engine, uma ferramenta de 2004, j  n o faz gr ficos t o elaborados como a CryEngine (de  FarCry 3 ) ou a Frostbite 2 (de  Battlefield 3 ). Cen rios como Aztec ou Italy s o bem detalhados e divertidos de serem revisitados.Existem efeitos de luz din mica e fuma a volum trica que enchem os olhos e esse resultado pode ser obtido mesmo em computadores com placas mais populares   leia-se: n o muito caras.Por outro lado,   not vel a queda de  qualidade gr fica nos consoles, principalmente no PlayStation 3, que mostra texturas mais lavadas e com taxa de atualiza  o em 30 quadros por segundo - uma qualidade bem abaixo do que estamos acostumados a ver em jogos atuais.  Pontos Negativos  Poucas novidadesFaltam bons motivos para justificar o retorno de ""Counter-Strike"". Por mais que bata a saudade de reunir amigos para um 'coruj o' em uma LAN House, fica a pergunta: por que jogar ""Global Offensive""?As duas novas modalidades e os mapas in ditos n o s o motivos suficientes para voltar ao mundo de  Counter-Strike .  O mais prov vel   que, a longo prazo, as pessoas continuem jogando o modo cl ssico de  Counter-Strike  e nos mesmos mapas de sempre (Aztec, Dust, Italy etc.) - e se divertindo como sempre aconteceu nas vers es 1.6 e  Source .A situa  o   ainda mais complicada para quem joga nos consoles que, al m de n o poder jogar os mapas criados pela comunidade, ainda corre o risco de ser abandonado pela Valve, como j  aconteceu com as vers es de  Team Fortress 2  para X360 e PS3.",2015-10-17,29,76561198059555148,730,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2333,0,1

Probably not.To save myself from repeating too much of what other reviews have said, I will simply say, too little content for too big of a price.Yes, the bullet cam is pretty, and the performance has undoubtedly increased since V2, although a maxed out game is very very taxing, often dropping below 60 frames on my 2x GTX680s in SLI..  But it seems as though Rebellion has tried to save the pretty mediocre story, the generic, ""go shoot this person"" style of gameplay and the HUGE lack of content (4 rifles, 4 subs and 3 pistols, no more than 9 levels and huge lack of multiplayer and cooperative stages) by simply tying the whole mess together with the recurring Xray bullet cam, overall giving us a game that is not fun to play given the frustrating problems (objects failling to render at distance, predetermined paths despite quite large maps).  Add this frustrating gameplay with the overall lack of content and you'll be left with very few hours of fun and most likely an unfinished story.Side notes--A $10 DLC came free if you preordered the game at a $10 discount- a nice $20 off, but still probably not worth buying.-Weapon and mission DLCs available VERY early on.. as much as I hate to admit it, even Call of Duty offers more value in their DLCs-A personal annoyance is the way the sound masking works.. if you attempt to cover the sound of your fire with, say, a malfunctioning generator, this can be done.. but if one is to fire at the most MARGINAL time after the actual sound of the generator stops, the enemies will automatically detect you, even though if this were to work in real life (even though a backfire is obviously quite different to the sound of a gunshot), would they not  fail to recognise the shot after the backfires have finished due to lack of recognition of it being a gunshot?  EI, if a gunshot can be hidden amongst a similar sound, why can the gunshot not be disguised at any time if they were to just think the gunshot is a backfire?",2014-07-08,373,76561197972244272,238090,Sniper Elite 3,132,0,0

I dont think I have ever done that for any game in beta, chosing to wait until it is a finished product. But this was simply the 4X game I was looking for at the time, and there are some reasons why it stands apart from other 4X's at the moment, and why you might want to think about getting it.Unit customisation - In GC3 you make military decisions from your technology choices through to the artistic choices you make for your units. Do you want Lasers, Rail guns, Missles??? Armor Plating? Shields? Are you going to have Terran looking cruisers? or the most alien creations you can imagine? I had a truely fun time every opportunity I had to design a new ship.Star bases - Probably one of my favourite aspects of GC3 were the use of star bases. Having extra things to throw resources at when a planet has filled its current building possibilities was great, and I think is missing from other 4X games. There are though many finishing touches to be made to GC3. But with the community around it the mod's that will come should make this game the 4X in space game every one has been waiting for.

I mean, the shaky cam gave me a headache, and for the first time in my life I got to experience motion sickness. Once I figured out where they hid the option for the shaky cam (hint: it's in the controls section), I finished the main game in only 3 hours... without rushing.The main story revolves around Kane and Lynch getting together for one more job. Everything goes to hell, and you shoot your way out. That is pretty much the whole story, right there. I wish I was kidding right now.The game was short, repetitive, and for the most part, downright awful. Aiming sucked, the cover-based mechanics were sub-par, and the story was nowhere to be found. The graphics, while alright in some places, were stitched together with overused lighting effects, and what J. J. Abrams would consider to be too many lens flares. This was likely used in an attempt to hide their rushed graphics.They also do this weird thing in the game where they censor headshots... you shoot someone in the head, a big blur spot appears and breaks immersion. If you want to kill a game, this is a good place to start. Was it supposed to be artistic, like the shaky cam?I'm really not sure there is much to recommend with this game, I barely stuck with it long enough to finish it.Graphics: 6/10 (once you turn off shaky cam)Story: 2/10 (Hey, we're shooting people... that's a story, right?)Gameplay: 5/10 (it was playable, not much else)Overall: ... 3/10?

The PC port is also pretty good, it runs well even on older hardware. Not to mention the game's graphics are pretty amazing. While the game strays far away from Resident Evil's horror style and goes into action, I don't think you should let that stop you from enjoying the game for what it is.

It has come a long way from the original Black Ops, but same to say, it still has a long way to go.The multiplayer is a solid experience, different game modes and tons of new achievements that'll just keep you entertained and hungering for more for hours upon hours, the leveling system has been somewhat modified so it is increasingly harder to level. The only thing that particularly bothered me whilst playing Multiplayer 6v6 were the hitboxes, spraying and even ADS didn't manage to do enough damage to enemies whilst they outplay me when you've probably done more than enough to kill them, just didn't make sense. But I'm sure time will fix it.I've stuck to Hardcore mode because it became a little more easier for my playstyle and at the same time, a lot more difficult.Zombies has a long way to go in my honest opinion, the first Map is quite the challenge when it comes to solo. No difficulty adjustment like BO2 either. I tried giving Public Zombies a go and the lobby of 3 other people I was supposed to be queued with turned out to be another 11 people in the lobby when there is ONLY supposed to be 4 max, I didn't like that, especially on release. So Public matched Zombies isn't a thing for me, yet. I've tried queueing multiple times and I always get a big lobby, whenever it tries to connect to the game it just kicks everyone from the lobby because of the increase in people.The campaign is a nice platform right now, just like in any other Call of Duty game. It has the storyline, the twist, and the ending. It's definitely taken a turning point from BO2 in every aspect of the game, just with so many more mechanics and twists. I still haven't gotten into it yet but time will come as I upgrade my PC so I can enjoy the experience that little bit more from increasing texture quality and AA.Overall, the game seems relatively complete, it still has a lot of work to do.I'd rate this game a solid 7/10. I enjoyed the hours I've put into it, it was an entertaining few. I'm just going to wait for the DLC and see what that has in store for the game.",2015-11-08,75,76561198059768123,311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,416,0,1

You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards.

So far only the graphics to play this are letting it down in my opinion (my specs below.)  I hope with more optimization and when DX12 comes out soon it will get a lot better. To list this out.Pro sDeep rewarding crafting System.levelling system.Massive open world full of horrors and thing's that want you for food.Fun tribe system with friends.Solo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before online.Dev's actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day one.Con'sRequires graphics tweaking even for higher cards.Some small physics bugs e.g. body's flying and being tossed away abit.Mostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphics.But after all that I ll keep playing it, because I so far find this the most enjoyable Survival game out.Computer Spec'sProcessor.Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz Graphics Card.NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Ram.Kingston HyperX Beast 16.0 GB OS.Microsoft Windows 8.1, 64-bit Upgrading my GTX760 soon to a new GTX970 (about 2ish weeks away)Will update my review when It's installed & I've played it.I wish there was more than Yes/No for review Early Access games, but so far if you can tweak the graphics right I recommend this over other early access survival games.Thanks for reading.Deatheffekt.Update #1 Patch 171.511 Hours mostly all in game I doubt even an hour is in the menu/server list, and I honestly say if you can get this running get it, I've loved every second of it.The updates since day one have been great, the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing, the hard work the dev's are doing will pay off, and I honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this.",2015-06-03,54,76561198059602670,346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,82,0,1

Alan Wake, a survival horror game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Game Studios. You are Alan Wake a best selling thriller novelist trapped in a horror story he wrote which has to come to life and has taken his wife. The game is heavily inspired by thriller which draws concepts from the T.V show Twin Peaks and draws inspiration from the works of Stephen King! As Alan Wake you must battle through the night to fight the Taken, a darkness that takes over living things and brings life to inanimate objects while trying to find yourself and your wife, which the darkness has taken. Gameplay is in third person and the primary weapon used in the game is light (Flashlight, Flares, flareguns, environmental lighting, flashbangs) as well as guns.  Fighting through lush green national parks and into the town of Bright Falls, Washington the atmosphere psychologically engulfs you, waking up from this nightmare is not an option!Pros:-The use of light as a weapon-A great story, short but sweet will really leave you with a ""Wow, amazing!""-The atmosphere although intense is also distrubing and horrifying-Narration really makes it easy to understand whats really going on.-Truly is a great looking game, feels like you're really in a national park XD-Highly replayabe, played through about 4 times-Combat mechanics make you feel like your are constantly in danger-Stephen king, Stephen king, Stephen king, Stephen king!Cons:-Weak ending-The game was a little short but there are DLC as well as American Nightmare.-Facial animations could've been done better-The recaps at the end of each chapter aren't necessary, it does feel like its trying to be a T.V showBut all in all a solid and rich game full of awesome, 10 foxes out 10 foxes, put de lime in de coconut!",2014-08-31,300,76561198059582003,108710,Alan Wake,52,0,1

I am a GIANT clicker fan, starting with cookie clicker, to Adventure Capatalist (of what is more of an Idle game) to Clicker Heroes! But this clicker is my favourite.  Here's why.1. It has AIMING! As with all bland games, aiming makes things better! Such as my favourite MMO of all time, Wildstar.So when this clicker had aiming I knew it was worth a ""Shot"". (Yes, that was a pun).2. It was based on one of the coolest games in the VR Universe, Time Rifters. To be based in the same scenery is a lovely trip to your brains memory compartment, if you haven't seen that game, then it's just a cool place to be in general.3. Its got great progression! Not at one point did I feel It was going too fast or too slow, and when I needed money the most, a Rainbow Money Ball would come along and help me out!So in total this is the greatest Clicker/Idle/Shooter of all time!

Upon arrival at the Bastion, The Kid sees an elderly man, known to us as 'Rucks'. Now, this beautifully voiced man is the narrator for most of the game, and I argue, someone whom truly makes the game what we all know and love. Logan Cunningham, the voice of Rucks, has made an appearance in another SuperGiant Game that I will be writing a review for shortly.So, after chatting Rucks up for awhile, they decide they need something known as 'Cores', in laymans terms, they are bits of immense power that they will use to power and upgrade the Bastion. From here, The Kid's journey is mostly centered around finding these Cores and using them to power the Bastion, to further one of two purposes..Massive.     ing. Spoilers. Ahead.So, the Bastion can offer it's survivors a choice. Do they continue to live as they are, happily in the air with one another, or do they give humanity a second chance, reversing the Calamity's effects. I won't go into great detail involving the plot or my personal choices, as I've much more to cover.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bastion's Soundtrack and Score -- I'm nothing but serious when I say this game's soundtrack is a perfect ten.Bastion's Art-Style - With a somewhat top-down Isometric viewpoint and some of the greatest visual effects I've seen used, Bastion earns my 9/10.Bastion, Plot-Wise - While confusing to someone who has never heard of the game, I give it 9/10, presenting you with several choices that will leave you confused and upset, wondering if you could've changed some things for the  better.And Overall, I give Bastion a 10/10.Bite me.",2015-08-23,300,76561198059582003,107100,Bastion,65,0,1

To start with, you play as a middle-aged man with a job in an office. Next you are an elderly man following the same route that your younger self did, only a little bit differently. Finally you play as a young boy. What's interesting is that the boy's snippet is the most different out of the three. While it didn't bring a tear to my eye, it certainly made me think of how peoples lives change as they grow up. Do yourself a favour and try it. Don't like the game? You've only lost five minutes of your life so no big deal, but I reckon you're foolish to say it didn't at least make you think on it.Pros:+Excellent story (or lack there of, it's your choice)Cons:-The camera movement feels a bit sluggish-Lack of content currently (as it is Early Access, expect this to change)",2015-05-17,84,76561198059691166,310370,The Way of Life Free Edition,6,0,1

I really dont know why it recomends a quad core 2.4gz cpu because the graphics resemble something from the early 2000's and either their rendering system is doing the crysis thing of rendering things that you cant even see, or something else is amiss, but the few servers i did try were dull and uneventfull. im not doing the narrow view thing and comparing to dayz (because frankly i think state of decay is a better zombie survival game) but i just found nether underwelming. dont get me wrong, I liked some of the texture details. and the mechanism as far as encorouging co-opperative play rather than just killing every1 2 steal their things. thats something that sux about most pvp/pve games. rust as an example, great game and well thought out, but most people will kill you rather than work with you to survive. but i liked the idea in this that you have clear reasons why you should work together. and the safe zones are cool. alot to do in there. I guess what Im trying to say is im underwhelmed at the moment and will have to just check back at a later point when things have been updated a bit more. look forward to future updates",2014-03-18,77,76561198059584657,247730,Nether,60,0,1

Most of the action takes place via flashbacks and while the game is quite linear the fast pace of the game more then makes up for it. The game took me 5 hours to finish and while it was short, i think the length worked well for the game and if the game dragged on for much longer it would have gotten very dry and boring. This game is really fun and worth playing even if you didn't like previous Call of Juarez games.",2014-01-13,33,76561198059779473,204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger,0,0,1

Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you re a Call of Duty player, you re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas   entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location   but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",2015-10-20,29,76561198059555148,730,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2333,0,1

With a total of 4 factions to chose from now (assuming you also have 8 Bit Armies) the 8-bit experience is definately much deeper  than before with larger selections of units and strategies. Military vs Fantasy is also pretty cool. I do believe however, the game is a little unbalanced (eg mass air ), but that is to be expected as the game has just come out. There are also a few typos here and there (eg the tech trees). It would also be pretty cool if we could still have the 8-Bit Armies music in the game when the original factions are selected.

The ""end game"" is attempting higher scores on specific tracks while the ""main game"" is progress through 6 worlds, with the 6th being no more than a play to wrap the game up and roll credits.Don't buy this game if you're expecting realistic physics or even blow-off valve accuracy - you contantly paint black tyre marks which gives a nice artistic feel to your movements, though I would have much preferred a way to only show tyre marks only when actually skidding. This isn't a drifting simulator. This isn't a racing game. This is a chilled out explorer and you play the role of an AE86.I hope they make Absolute Drift 2 and give more substance. An ability to modify the car that would have an effect on the physics would be cool as well as camera angles. Obviously multiplayer for some door-on-door drifing action would be great and anything to make this a game that you'd want to go back to once you unlocked everything that needed to be unlocked.Is it worth US$11.99?

It is true, the environment and the atmosphere is tense and realistic - but not fun.Cons:- Pay to win (Not as much as other games but still noticable)- Bad optimisation- Bad matchmaking system and vehicle pairing- No Asian/Oceania servers (Though could probably afford it thanks to the first con)Microtransactions:There is so much paid content in this game and a heavy reliance on purchasing premium currency to progress without sprending countless hours to unlock a new weapon or vehicle, before spending even longer earning the money for the overpriced weapons.Optimisation:No matter what I do, I can't help but find myself suffering from immense performance issues, despite graphics settings.Matchmaking:As I mentioned earlier the environment is not a fun one. This game seems overly biased towards the Allied powers, and the matchmaking of armoured vehicles in particular is complete trash. I recently purchased my Jagdpanzer 38t (Hetzer) Medium Tank Destroyer. I took it into battle for the first time before being spawn-camped by M4A3E8 Shermans and M18 Hellcats, both of which were not widely used against Hetzers. In fact, my vehicle cannot even penetrate the front of the Sherman, which were well known as lightly armoured tanks (If they were M4A3E2 Jumbos it would make sense, but ir wouldn't be historically accurate - again).Asia/Oceania Server:Non-existent. There seems to be a fairly large community of players in the Asia and Oceania regions, who both have to deal with locally-hosted Skirmishes and nothing else. War battles are dominated by American and European players and so the servers have several hundred ping (300 approx.).Overall Thoughts:This game looks promising but is incredibly dissappointing. If these issues are fixed I will consider coming back to this game. I rate it a 5/10 unless you are a Mr or Mrs Moneybags who can stuff the developers' bank accounts with cash.",2024-01-23,121,76561198059566639,227940,Heroes & Generals,39,0,0

What i hate most about telltale is that they take forever to dish out episodes ( 1 episode = roughly 46min -hr..there are 5 episodes..) srsly like every 2-3 months a new hour of play is ready ..camon and its not like the graphics are high detail anyway, any potato computer can run then again we are in 2015! telltale is srsly becoming one of my top hated companies becasue, thers no effort in visuals, characters, they milk any franchise they come across.. they are the EA of 'choose your own adventures' so to speak. sorry if this is unreadable i was drunk when i wrote this. Overall telltales sucks and need to get it together, some solutions can be to make the episodes longer and more choices the players can make, dont make a game where the gamer just wathces everything if i want to watch ill go to netflix. i am very very dissapointed and would be embarrased to work at telltale - rant over",2015-01-29,300,76561198059582003,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,0,0,0

The story in this game has so many different choices and endings it feels like a different game everytime you choose a different path. The graphics are unreal and beat everything realeased, even today, the animations and voice acting is superb and the sounds are so clear and music is amazing and it fits really well into the dark fantasy world. There are some memorable tracks to this game which have made their way into my playlists.The combat style is not different from most rpg's, hack and slash, magic spells (called signs) and potions. Some people say it came out as half baked, but I love it and it really gets you to think about your stategy, especially against large groups of enemies. The constanting rolling around that you ahve to do to avoid enemy attacks is rather tiresome, as blocking is ineffective against many different enemies. The different skill trees are all very well balanced and each skill impacts combat and how you play big time. The drawback with the alchemy system is that potions can only be consumed outside of combat, so constantly saving before entering a new room is advisable, so it is possible to reload without worrying if you have lost a large portionof time spent doing quests. The main protagonist, Geralt of Rivia is a badass monster slayer who you just love form first sight (much like his hot girlfriend Triss!!). And the most hyped up and important part of the game, the story is written and directed like a AAA movie title, only ten times better! Going through the prologue is like watching Game of Thrones, it is awesome.This game also utilises Witcher 1 saves so all the different choices and descisions you made in that, impact your Witcher 2 game! The story's allusions to the whole witcher univerrse allow you to roleplay the witcher effectively, but the main plot pulls Geralt out of his main profession, he turns away from his witchering throughout much of the main plot, with only a few quests showing off his full monster hunting aspect. This game is magnificent, it is a visual feast and contains a plot which constantly twists and turns and gets you to think long and hard about decisions you make over your favourite characters.Overall - 99/100 Must play!",2013-07-27,121,76561198059566639,20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,217,0,1

Different from anything I have ever played before. Mostly I stick to FPS and driving games such as my favorite Tactical Intervention which has both FPS and driving together so its my favorite game. But Depth offers a total ""other world"" experience both pragmatically and literally in that in effect it offers FPS and scuba diving as well as taking on the persona of THE SHARK...LOL! Which is probably the most unique feature I have ever experienced in any game. While it is not over simple in that there is a very small learning curve it is a very small curve especially after completing the free game tutorial. As a matter of fact if you complete the tutorial you are even rewarded for that with a free skin that you would have to otherwise purchase with in game money! After the tutorial you have pretty much over come the learning curve and you will know how to play. I would recommend this game to any FPS player looking for something unique and different. I will buy it now that I have tried it whether it was on sale or not. The game is at a great price this weekend but I would buy it at full price now that I have tried it. Its well worth the money even at full price. You won't be dissapointed with this game. It is a lot of fun. Buy it!",2024-08-20,373,76561197972244272,274940,Depth,13,0,1

That's because the game was originally on Mac and iOS and is currently in the process of being ported to Windows. (I usually play on V2 Mac.) But if you check the updates, the V3 Steam version is slowly but constantly getting better, catching up to its v2 counterpart. Additionally, some of the microtransactions mentioned in negative reviews are on the way out. There's no more skill cap and now everyone gets unrestricted access to all biomes.Anyway, I should tell a bit about what Deepworld is.Deepworld is an online multiplayer sandbox game. A notable aspect is the fact that every single server/world is linked together via world teleporters. This makes it easy to travel between worlds, to go mining, exploring, questing, building, and so on. You can build something cool and show it to your friends or the public, or you can visit other people's creations. There's a place for everything.The sandbox aspect means you can build whatever you can think of. Building materials are easy to aquire.Remember: Deepworld is always in development.

The Political aspects were very Intense in how they were carried out. The thought of this being a valid possibilty has struck me more than once during my run through it. Yet i enjoyed the Story itself, despite what has happened.Regarding the two Characters you see throughout the story, they are too Life-like to be regarded as just AI (One having more reason to be more so than another).

Only downside is the missions are terrible. All of the stronghold takeovers are exactly the same, even the same order of doing things and the story isn't very immersive, but that gives way to mods.

Such as the in-game virtual store consists of characters (Heroes/Champions like in DOTA, HoN or LoL) whereby people can pay real money to acquire specific characters to play with, or simply by playing the game and earning in-game currency (which takes ages) to buy them. Additionally, cosmetic skins which was widely successful in LoL and as a direct result many developers sees the potential in this and hence they try to do the same.In a nutshell, it's SMITE with a bunch of near half-naked anime-like characters and SOME male characters.

At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards.

Home is a short, pixelated, side scrolling horror game, which is based heavily on reading and exploration. Given the details mentioned this game is surely not for everyone, but putting that aside, why is it good?Home is a very atmospheric game, giving players just ambience to listen to throughout the 1 hour long experience (I use this word instead of game on purpose), the story follows a man who has woken up in a strange, unkown place, and is set the main obkective of returning home, to find his wife. As you get closer to home the story delves deeper and more questions arise, finding strange objects and horrifying scenarios, but maintaining zero jump scares.Home was enjoyable to play, being a game I could start and finish in one sitting, but as stated earlier there is no really exciting gameplay, but more of a filmic experience.

The religions gone, which im alright with because it was kinda hard to control and influence anyway, but less is more?The units, while the idea of upgrading them along a specifc line is cool and kind of felt like x-com, the actually outcome of this is that they look slightley different each time and don't really do anything special, you can't have that civ 5 x2 attack, +1 range super units that took investment, and time, which you cared about when they died, because now the only individual upgrades are %10 attack. and also the units are all just re skins of the warrior etc, not thats its a bad thing, just don't get excited, why couldn't they do somehting like have mutliple worlds to travel to or go back to earth, which makes a whole new map.And wheres the submarines, the bombers, AA units, the paratroopers, also satellites could have been much more, i feel like they should have been super expensive, powerful and be moveable, and only visible to a few units which could take them out easy. and wheres the airport or teleporter, or something to move units quickly, satellite tele doesn't really count because its one way. and also the fact that units are so boringly upgraded means you don't get the cool feeling when a helecopter gunship is mowing down a knight.It suffers from the same problem civ 5 had in my opinion, which was that the happiness meant you had to wait till like turn 200 to actually start a war or anything because you had NO happiness, and if you tried to found cities your happiness was gone. So this time around the happine.. i mean health is even more limited, no health from tile resources, so you rely on like the 3 almost identical buildings which give like 2 health each. Also most buildings suck, like 100 buildings that give +3 science or energy (gold), but none that add multipliers, and the few wonders there are barely have anything good about them.Another thing, i felt is that the affinities were really loosely tied to you, your not tied down, so you don't really feel that close to them, if you research all techs you pretty much have them all anyway, and the random events which asked things like if some building should be +science or energy made it seem like you have less control over your civilization.The start up options, this might have been the most disappointing thing, there isn't really anything special to the sponsors, they don't have personality like ghandi or ashurbanipal did (however you spell it). then after the sponsor all the other stuf is really on early game thing like starting with a worker, also quick thing, why can't i have a duel map with 24 players like i used to be able to do, that was so fun. and wheres the unique unitsThe look is also just werid, i know they were going for alien, but that doesn't mean every fricken thing on the map needs to be purple. and like on the tech tree, thers no colour to the pictures, just symbols, makes it look even more boring.(also cities are so weak, can be captured by 2 melee units)all that said i really only focused on what i didn't like, if you have never played civ before this will be a great game for you, but currently if your coming out of civ 5 theres not really enough change to justify the price and i will probably still invest 100s of hours because while they didn't improve the formula, like making decagonal tiles or anything, the formula was good enough. so i give this a recommended if looked at independantly of previous installments (just like i would for COD, spooky)420/68.99-IGN (get it becaus.. ok ill just go kill myself)can i have some internet points now gaben?",2014-10-25,176,76561198059611702,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,466,0,0

But sadly there is an element of human interaction which can be both friendly or hostile. You will soon find that everyone is HOSTILE. I do not know why but other players rarely if ever show reciprocity. It is quite demeaning to spend 2 hours building a base and crafting for it to just get destroyed by rage-kids with rocket launchers. This game has a nice concept, despite its good intentions, other players are a large error factor which ruins a good game.  I am displeased at best by this game, it runs terribly on a GTX980 with a lot of frame dips. After doing some research I found that it is poorly optimised for most newer systems. So if you have a 980, 970, 780, 770 you will not be able to run this game as smoothly as you should.   I am very disappointed by this game, it is a good game but the players are the most unlikeable     holes you will ever encounter. Most players kill other players just because they are unable to defend themselves. I can only imagine those trigger happy players and anti-social sociopath with little empathy and respect for others work and effort. I do not blame the developer for the players, but I blame him (the developer) for the poor optimization.   To summarise; This game runs poorly on $1895 PC's The players are malevolent vindictive bullies with no respect for others Its overpriced and over rated. It makes my blood boil with rage.  DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO GET ANNOYED BY ARROGANT SOCIO PATHS.

Even after several whacks at a zombie which would've executed it, the thing still gets up and comes for you. What could've been a very atmospheric apocalyptic action side-scroller is ultimately a chore of the game with a bore of a story. Even for the price point, please do yourself a favour and avoid this mediocre piece of garbage.

For example, you claim to be a ""vigilante"" but really you are just a criminal that occasionally does something good. The hacking itself is pretty basic, but plays with some interesting ideas. You really do feel like you have power over the city and it makes the game really enjoyable. The combat system is really simple and a bit annoying, but it does what it needs to do well. The game looks ok, but I have to run it on high/medium settings, so it's more my fault than the game's. There is a LOT to do that will keep you entertained, but sometimes the side quests that pop up on the screen can get a bit annoying. The multiplayer is good but a little lacking. I would have loved to see a open world multiplayer where you can do whatever you want with your friends in this amazingly open world. Overall a really good game, one of my favourites already. I can see myself playing it for a long time. As for a rating, well maybe around an 8/10 for me. I was really looking forward to being a bringer of justice, but I was let down as it feels like another GTA with a bit of crime stopping.",2014-05-30,223,76561197972224447,243470,Watch_Dogs,0,0,1

If you don't like hard games then you might want to steer clear, but even as a very difficult game there is plenty to enjoy. The difficulty can be both punishing and forgiving, as you die in one hit, but thankfully the game only restarts you back to the start of the area. The gameplay is fast-paced and suspenseful, keeping you on your toes for the whole game as you attempt to take out all the bad guys in one area without taking a hit. The game forces you to implement some strategy and stealth into the action, making an excellently balanced blend of fun which is surprisingly addictive as you try over and over again to pass the area.The setting and story also help the game immensely. The Miami setting gives the game a great colour palette to work with, and makes the top-down world look vibrant and safe, a contrast to the actual gameplay. And the story....it's confusing, but done so well as to make you guess what is going on, and allows you to speculate on several things, like the guy who appears in every store you go to after each level, and acts oblivious to the fact. But you know there's something to him.All in all, Hotline Miami is well worth the $10 pricetag, and you should definitely get it when it's on sale, even if you aren't interested.",2013-12-30,300,76561198059582003,219150,Hotline Miami,154,0,1

Scott has really improved on the games, since now he can manage to make the animatronics actually move infront of your eyes. Scotts thing about 'Only one' really worked out, since the older animatronics are now in hallucination form.My main issue with the game is that the jumpscares arent very scary, since most of the time you can see them coming. For example, if you see Phantom BB on the cameras, you know you will be jumpscared. They arent that scary in general too. Another issue is that it dosent really explain the mechanics that well to you, I dont know how to get rid of SpringTrap when he is in your office window/ door.Overall, it is a very good game.",2015-03-07,74,76561198059609375,354140,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,127,0,1

It's been said by the developers that they don't want to be another Dayz clone though, so by it's finished stage it'll end up being something new and different.This game really strives off of human interaction, either you can trust everyone or trust no one. In the end your still going to die though....The best thing you can do if you plan to buy this game is look for a freind who'll play it with you. The game is fun by itself, but with a friend it makes the game a better experience. Not saying you can't go lone wolf and find groups to build with and/or raid others.The feel/atmosphere of the game feels like a cavemen era game, though once you get into the game you'll realise these cavemen can craft a lot of nifty things. Be warned, if you see a guy in a red jacket, blue pants and a bennie..... Get the hell out of there!Once alpha is finished and this goes into beta or full release we'll end up with an exceptionally great game!Also a Pro tip: Press F1 in-game and type censor.nudity false to see all the glory hiding behind everyones pants :)",2014-02-12,10,76561198059575326,252490,Rust,4329,0,1

You can't do anything to change what happens outside of cases, You're just there to enjoy the cutscenes, which are movies in their own rights. I noticed one glitch within the game and two cutscenes were probably out of sync, but you'll barely notice. If you haven't given this game a shot, you may not like it anyway. BUT, If you want to be a hero of the 1940's police force, experiance just what it was like back then, the corruption, drugs, drinking, the one-way views, broken heros from the war and people who are frankly, just broken...

The protagonist is just a guy who feels sorry for himself and thinks too much, heaps of inner dialogue that jump from one topic to the next not really serving any purpose besides telling the reader what we already know from a paragraph or so in; he feels sorry for himself. Instead of assuming we know that by now, this concept gets dragged on for such a long time making -me- feel sorry for myself as he goes on and on about his boring lifestory. I think what makes it really hard for me to continue playing is my lack of interest in the protagonist as a character I will have to put up with the whole visual novel through. While I understand his sentiments and probably the purpose of him being so lifeless before he gets to the actual camp and 'lives it up' or something like that, I still don't get it and I don't agree with the execution. Another thing that bothered me was the blurr effects in the beginning when he looks around his room. I don't quite understand the purpose of that and it just annoyed me. Is he still sleepy or something? Why can't he talk about that instead of how ordinary and uninteresting his life is? At least that would serve an actual purpose.Like I said, I haven't played much and I wanted to give it a chance but it is what it is. It may be considered as a 'visual novel loved by many' in the description but I'm sorry, count me out. It just isn't for me.Soviet Games, I hope you continue making more visual novels to come with your beautiful assets and put more thought into the writing delivery/ cut out the unnecessary bits because the length of a story doesn't equal quality.

Ent o faltando um m s pro lan amento do cap tulo 5 eu vi no youtube ( at  em um canal que n o conhecia, EletronicDesireGE ) achei a historia do jogo muito interessante e fiquei curioso para saber a conclus o. Decidi ent o compr -lo e posso dizer que n o me arrependo nem um pouco, nunca um jogo mexeu tanto comigo como LIS e olha que j  joguei v rios jogos incr veis com enredos fant sticos ( a saga Metal Gear por exemplo   um dos melhores jogos que j  joguei em toda a minha vida ). J  me emocionei v rias vezes jogando alguns jogos, mas nunca cheguei ao ponto de chorar ( eu diria que at  muito no cap tulo 5 ) como foi em Life Is Strange. Enfim, vamos aos finalmentes.Hist ria - 10 ( J  falei praticamente tudo anteriormente ; N o vou falar sobre o enredo mas   o ponto forte do jogo. De in cio parece ser aqueles dramas de adolescentes mas garanto que n o e   muito mais profundo ).Gr ficos - 9 ( ou 10, meu PC n o   dos melhores ent o joguei tudo no m dio ).Trilha sonora - 10 ( as m sicas simplesmente se encaixaram perfeitamente em todos os momentos do jogo mesmo nem todas sendo originais ) .Gameplay - 10 ( apesar de bem simples responde bem aos comandos e n o deixa a desejar, mas nem todos gostam desse estilo mais ""parado"", j  eu n o tive problemas nem com bugs graves e comprometedores apenas alguns objetos flutuando ).Personagens - 10 ( todos s o muito carism ticos e memor veis com personalidades bem diferentes e legais, as vozes tamb m n o deixam a desejar e tudo saiu perfeito ).Como disse anteriormente LIS mexeu muito comigo e recomendo a todos que gostam de uma  tima historia, pode ser ruim para os que n o entendem em ingl s ( n o entendo 100 % t mbem ) mas para isso tem a tradu  o nos sites DivinityPT e Casal Bits que fizeram um trabalho muito bom com poucos erros que n o comprometem no entendimento do game.Gostaria de encerrar essa an lise parabenizando o incr vel trabalho ( da Square Enix tamb m ) que a DONTNOD Entertainment fez com o jogo e espero que essa seja a primeira de v rias obras de artes que eles possam fazer pois virei um f  do game e irei recomendar a todos, se tornou um dos melhores games que j  joguei ( ap s o t rmino do cap. 4 fiquei uns dias pensativo e quando terminei o jogo fiquei uns 5 dias com uma sensa  o esquisita, como se fosse tristeza ) e que me fez pensar muito sobre a vida, sobre tudo. Obrigado por essa incr vel experi ncia e pela tristeza que vai permanecer por um tempo ap s ter conclu do o jogo.Desculpe aos erros de portugu s e por repetir varias palavras muitas vezes.",2015-10-25,77,76561198059584657,319630,Life Is Strange ,1010,0,1

Sniping the men who are following you because you blew up their convoy of jeeps. And let's not forget to mention. Those graphics on the explosions are the best I've seen of every game that has chaos in it. Not only is their one huge island full of mysterious temples and WWII ruins, but also a second large island and a completely separate island for the co-op mode.

Turns out, it doesn't matter.The game starts off well enough with the jewelry store heist in the first chapter; picking locks and pockets is initially thrilling enough to get any kleptomaniac's heart racing. Eventually as the game progresses, it becomes evident that the NPC AI has been pared down to the point that sneaking around isn't much of a challenge. What is challenging though, is the way in which missions are replayed. Want to go back and play through a chapter to pick up that missed bit of loot? Well, forget about selecting the mission from the menu, you'll need to head back into the area in The City hub where the mission began. Hardly intuitive when there's no option for fast travel and the map is absolute rubbish. In addition, the story is bland, and the characters aren't very engaging. There are issues with the sound, too, which ruin the atmosphere when you're trying to be quiet and you hear a loud voice, which must surely mean someone's in the room with you and you're about to be discovered. Nope, the person talking is outside. Across the road. In another building. On a more positive note, the art design is great, the buildings and surroundings appear to be painstakingly crafted.  Sadly, this doesn't warrant purchasing a game, so I'd wait until there's a substantial discount. $5 and Thief would be a steal.",2014-05-20,73,76561198059603669,239160,Thief,0,0,0

I misheard. I thought you said ""how are we gonna get MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON STEAM"".Performance:This game runs horribly. I used to run at low settings, 1080p, with AA and 8x Anisotropic filtering, and run at a solid 60fps. Now I run 900p with AA off and 2x Anisotropic, and the game runs at 40fps. Rocksteady need to sort out their PC port. They had to relaunch there game because of the port, and it went from bad at launch, better after an update, to worse than ever after a 2.5gb patch. Gameplay:The batmobile in the game seems a bit overused. It is used for a lot of puzzles, and gets a bit boring. The combat is as fun as ever, utilizing counters a lot. Rocksteady have added some new moves as well. The new gadgets such as the remote hacking device are fun and well utilized, and are actually very useful in many situations. For example, you can knockout a goon by turning on the escalator, or setting off an explosion. I do find it quite funny that once a goon is knocked out, you can shoot them as much as you like with your lethal cannons and guns on the batmobile. Of course they are not dead though, because that would make it too dark.Missions:There is a good variety of story missions in the game, and a lot of side missions as well. An example of variety in the story is  Scarecrow fills the city streets with fear toxin and you must travel around the city on the rooftops. The final mission of the game involves running around as joker destroying weeping angel like statues of batman.  At this point, I have finished the story, and it is a good length. It did not drag on like Saints row (my opinion as Saints row IV got very boring as I played the story), and is not too short like Mirrors Edge (an enjoyable game, but I was finished with the story within 3 hours). The side missions contain a lot of the regular batman villians, like Two Face and Penguin, and involve stopping their crime gangs for good. These are fun, and give you a lot of upgrade points, which like the other batman games, let you upgrade gadgets, and unlock new moves.Conclusion:Batman: Arkham Knight is a very fun game. The story is enjoyable, and even 29 hours in I am enjoying slowy completing all the quest lines. I just wish that Rocksteady would fix their PC port. It makes the game in some cases unplayable, and I will most likely be refunding the game when I get the oppurtunity.Performance score: 3 (at least it boots up)Gameplay score: 8 (excessive use of the batmobile)Missions score: Side missions: 9 (a lot of batmobile use, but feels satisfying to take down crime gangs and villians)                          Story missions: 9 (great ending, and lots of variety. Again, a lot of batmobile use)OVERALL SCORE: 6 (not reccomended on PC because of performance, but if you own a console, buy it on that peasant machine)",2015-11-06,105,76561198059749348,208650,Batman : Arkham Knight,2069,0,0

The game features a solid, enjoyable campaign that visits varied locations and harnesses an abundant range of weapons which raise the quality of what could otherwise be a stereotypical, conventional and ultimately dull set of missions. Movements and gunplay is fairly smooth and rarely descends into frustrating territory. Locations pop with colour and life, and there's a bona-fide sense of realism present throughout the environment, even when the mission you are completing is anything but. The real highlight and the most popular aspect of Bad Company 2 is the immensely popular multi-player mode. With it's vast maps, unique and diverse arsenal of weapons and great team mechanics, Bad Company 2's multi-player triumphs over its counterpart and frequently compared franchise Call of Duty in many respects. Teams feel more close-knit and dependant on each other than most other multi-player games and locations feel more expansive too. Moments of tension and anticipation, speculating what your opponents will attempt next are nail bitingly pleasant. Making tactical decisions and planning your movements requires more brain-power and strategizing than what may be expected, but when your plan achieves success, the feeling of jubilation is unmatched. It really is a game mode most enjoyed with friends who enjoy planning out their moves and attempting to execute them with precision. And with an addictive levelling up system, you'll find it hard to pull yourself away.Bad Company 2 is a great game and is a genuine classic in the shooter genre. With it's gradually decreasing popularity thanks to the newer instalments in the Battlefield franchise, it's a smart idea to purchase this while the game's community is still thriving. 8.5/10(Written a while ago)",2015-04-13,29,76561198059733355,24960,Battlefield: Bad Company 2,610,0,1

I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it's certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn't have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I'll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.The Good -The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I'm talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you'll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn't mind seeing them in other games.-The Music: I'll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It's a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.The Okay-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can't sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can't. It's kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that's never a good thing.-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn't the best part of the game, you're not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.The Bad- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term ""bullet sponge"". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that's not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn't a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.All in all, RE:ORC is a game that's fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don't expect to be amazed by the game.",2015-05-23,58,76561198060075168,209100,Resident Evil : Operation Raccoon City,673,0,0

For those saying its just a glorified screensaver, to each their own. But make no mistake, there is actually quite a bit to do in Mountain.Looking out on the abyss in which your mountain floats is serene. Sometimes, terrifying, if your annihiliation is slowly flying towards you. Yes, it's not as flashy as COD, but I would take this over COD anyday. Just the quiet ambience, and the occasional lone, melancholy note signalling that your Mountain, this huge, hulking Mountain, has thought of something. Sometimes it reflects on the weather. Other times he expresses sadness and memories long forgotten. Controls-wise. Well, the music you can play. You can activate raging firestorms, fish, frogs, hearts, coins, or even blood. It all comes raining down upon your Mountain in a way that can be truly terrifying, engaging, or beautiful. Every now and again, your Mountain experiences a bit of cold weather, and snow comes down upon it, coating your little objects in white fluff. You can zoom in to examine these objects, these stray pieces of someone's or something's life, that come crashing into your Mountain from the cosmos. You can then move these objects, or feel joy/sadness as you purposefully/accidentally send them hurtling back into the void. You can express your distaste at clouds by waving your mouse wildly in defiance.The game is meant to be played when you want. I recommend checking up on it occasionally, but not actively playing if you don't feel like it. Check back if you hear the telltale ping of the Mountain's thoughts.The Mountain is thinking.

Let me tell you about it.First of all, some history.All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.Here's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.Here's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.Sign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!Frank",2015-02-23,223,76561197972224447,107410,Arma 3,1872,0,1

While that describes pretty much any PvP encounter, Civ 5 makes the process take dozens of  hours, and seem like minutes have passed -- while you scout terrain, check farms, build culture, try to invade neighbour cities, handle revolts, build more farms, expand territory using culture, build more farms, scout new areas, build more farms, expand roads, build more farms, you get the idea.at least there's automation to help you out, but the game is all about micromanagement and expanding, to the detriment of your sanity or sleep patterns. it's addictive, fun in a way you can only imagine is bad for you, and in a way, it's something you could play forever, if only the world was large enough to do so, and your enemies weren't also trying to cut you off and invade your territories at the same time as you're trying to move 5-14 soldiers quietly into the neighbourhood without them noticing.Definitely more fun in a multiplayer setting, but really unlikely that you'd get 3 other people wanting to spend 5 hours on diplomancy or culture-appreciation, when there's just the option to build up a military after 2-3 hours and take on all sides and call it victory when the connection breaks and the game crashes.",2013-08-11,300,76561198059582003,8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,1484,0,1

This truly add to the emersion of the game and I feel like it couldn't be better. Even after you find out what happened, it's paced rather well.However, while the build up to the ending was impecable, the ending, to me, felt rather rushed and just felt kind of sloppy in general. The ending has no real explanation behind it as two semingly, new characters are introduced and have very little impact on the story other than to tie up the game and force it to end.While I, personally, didn't like the ending; I'd definitely recomment it to anyone.

Warface is a try-hard, want to be Call of Duty with clunky, awful gameplay whilst trying (and failing) to implement tactical features and functions. Warface also has one of the worst Pay-2-Win systems I have ever experienced and actually makes me cringe to the core. There is an in-depth review below but the bottom line is; Don't play it. In-Depth Review  Gameplay Like I said above, the gameplay is clunky and doesn't ""flow"" well. I often find that sprinting makes my screen clanky and jagged and when I shoot my weapon it seems too.....rough? Pardon my low-effecient vocabulary. Tactical Play (with some community banter) One of the tactical features in Warface is to help one of your poor-tasted buddies onto a higher ledge and vice versa. I don't think the Devs knew how sh*t their games community was going to be (hint: it's very similiar to COD, maybe even worse) These features seem tacky and useless, used just to add some ""innovation"" to their game. Pay-2-Win Never in my life have I played a game where I have to RENT an ingame gun and not have the choice to keep it permanently, despite all those hard-earned game duckets I spent on it. Note: I haven't played that much of the game and do NOT have a full understanding of the market system. EZ game EZ life I'm really bad at Call of Duty, like awful, so I assumed that I would be bad at this also, that was until I went on a 15 kill streak in my first game. I know the majority of FPS is all just ""point-n-shoot"" but come ON FAM, THIS IS TOO EASY! Theres next to no recoil control or bullet drop, you can kill some nerd across the map with a couple of well placed bullets from the standard, beginner assault rifle and the slide feature allows any skirken to slide inbetween my legs and topple me even if he has awful aim NO SOUTH-PACIFIC REGIONAL SERVERS WTF!?!?! Crytek seems to think the world is a weird, pacman sort of shape because they apparently don't know New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa etc exist because they didn't create any f*cking dedicated servers for them, this is a personal issue but it should be resolved regardless of how bad the rest of the game is.

Security uses mostly military grade weapons (M16's, mk18's... anything you would expect to see the American army use), while Insurgents use mostly old Russian weaponry (AKM's, SKS's and FAL's). Each team has two squads, each with 8 roles to pick. The point system in the game balances out the amount of attachments and armor you can pick, giving you the choice to either deck out your gun with fore-grips and weapon sights and run un-armored, or armor yourself up and give yourself extra ammo with no optics or attachments on your gun. Most primary weapons are a one shot kill to the torso and head at all ranges which forces you to pick your cover and pathing to the objective carefully.There are 6 game modes for multiplayer: Skirmish, Push, Firefight, Ambush, Occupy and Strike. Skirmish and Firefight are objective zone based; go to the objective and occupy it until your team has captured it and eliminate all enemy players until their respawn waves are ceased, capturing an objective gives you a respawn wave. The only difference between Skirmish and Firefight is that Skirmish has an addition 2 objectives which can be destroyed. In Push one team needs to hold back the enemy from capturing the two objectives in each zone until their respawn waves run out. Occupy is the classic King of the Hill, Ambush is a VIP escort mission and in Strike you must destroy the enemies objective while you protect your own. Servers can hold up to 32 players (16 per team) and there is an addition co-op game mode.Overall Insurgency is a tense, strategic and realistic game, brought to you by a small and intuitive game studio that will give you endless hours of fun.Pros- Well structured maps that suit every game mode,          Extremely polished weapon models and weapon animations,          Limited Heads Up Display,          Harsh damage model/ Health System.Cons- Movement animations are a bit ""On rails"",           and Bullet ballistics are simple and outdated.",2014-10-01,300,76561198059582003,222880,Insurgency,102,0,1

Wasn't as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his. Our first night wasn't bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn't too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no. I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, ""Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!""-pls excuse bad inggris.",2015-07-01,2,76561198059555651,105600,Terraria,644,0,1

DLC from the game is ridiculous, the more you pay, the more stronger and better you are, but unless you actually put in time and effort to get the same results as the p2winners.Overall, Warframe can be naturally seen as a fps and p2w game, this game actually seemed more new, unlike the other modern-day fps like black ops.

You will be unable to find ANY good servers to play on since they are almost all set to ban you. I am quite sure they should be required to put a disclaimer about this as it practically renders the multiplayer unplayable for people with VAC bans. This is also that most people would assume that a VAC ban would not affect another game as evidence by Valve own VAC FAQ stating that particular fact. So yes, if you like WW2 squad based tactical FPS, and a solid NO if you have a VAC ban of any sort.

An average computer means glitchier zombies, horrible graphics, the ability to run through objects and other annoyances that can ruin the realistic feel that Dayz is trying to provide. But, as for many games, the enjoyment you will have depends on your frame of mind and the amount of time you are willing to put towards it.Not recommended for those with an average pc, but if you're willing to stick by the game during its development, the majority of glitches will hopefully be fixed and the player with an average pc can still have a good time playing Dayz.As for the players with a good pc, it's a good, fun game. However, the current lack of items and things to do can make it very time consuming and monotoneus (yes, that's  what you would expect from a game in this genre, but its far more time consuming than it should be), but don't worry, your efforts will eventually pay off and give you a load of enjoyment and an almost real survival experience, with the occasional glitch. The updates are slow, but once the developers get on the right track and make their minds up (and get their priorities right) Dayz should steamroll into the game everyone wants it to be.",2014-06-29,77,76561197971688382,221100,DayZ,170,0,1

It lacks any real form of cover, leaning, and most shockingly crouch, and the maps are incredibly linear. There's no notion of stealth or sniping or any serious problem solving. It's a very spam-y game. You just take on waves of enemies as they come. There are different sorts of enemies, but it doesn't matter much in terms of just sinking enough ammo into them until they die. Enemies drop four kinds of drops: health (green), rifle ammo (red), plasma gun ammo (blue), and nano (orange). You also have a shield but it regenerates automatically. You collect enough nano and you earn an upgrade. Both of your weapons as well as your general gear upgrade the same way. Everything has 5 modes (the last two of which get unlocked later) and each mode has 2 additional upgrades beyond the first for a total of 15 upgrades for each weapon and your gear. For weapons this tends to mean a primary attack, and secondary function or attack, and a passive bonus in each of the 5 modes. Each weapon uses the same ammunition for each attack and each mode, albeit at different rates.Your environment is pretty dangerous, there are high explosives all over the place as well as electrified items which, when damaged, shock everything within range for a period of time before exploding. Additional from time to time you encounter random flame-throwers in the walls. You can take down entire waves of enemies with just the explosive and electric death traps lying around.That's basically it. That's the entire game (as far as I've played it anyway).On the down-side, the gun play isn't all that imaginative and you don't always have time to swap to all your cool new upgrades in the heat of battle. This combined with the high linearity, wave format of enemy encounters, terrible terrible voice acting and story (not that it has any real impact on the game), and the fact that, despite what the pictures look like above, the artistic style really isn't all that nice, makes me sort of sigh and dream of what this game could have been.IMHO, what this game could have been is Shadow Warrior (Redux), which I believe was a perfect and shining example of what happens when you put modern game technology and philosophy into an old school shooter. In a sense, Hard Reset is like a poor man's Shadow Warrior. Definitely not worth the same amount of money (I just picked up Hard Reset for like 2.50 USD, sooo not complaining). On the upside though, if you do like your old school shooters, this is a good game. It does what it sets out to do. It's fun, it's destructive, it's fast paced (during combat sequences), and you can just go insane. Ammo conservation hasn't been a problem yet (normal difficulty). Over all, I haven't found the game to be really difficult at all, which is not to say that I haven't died yet. Bottom line is, I'm enjoying it, I'd recommend it, and though I haven't played it enough to comment on the complaints about its short length, I'd say even at full cost (15 USD) I think it's fair.TL;DR : Solid game, proper old school shooter experience, no major faults besides      story and acting, but nothing mind blowing either. I'd recommend it to friends.",2015-11-14,73,76561198059603669,98400,Hard Reset,60,0,1

It didn't really have any lore but that doesn't matter considering it's free. The game is so simple that you don't even need the ability to read in order to figure out what's going on so even if you were my neglected goldfish, you should still be able to play. I found this game intersting considering that it's about the most creative thing you will find in the last two-three years. If you take a look at the amount of re-used jokes in Family Guy or the shooter genre, you would probably agree.Pros:It's freeThe tutorial shows gameplay while teaching you (which is cool I guess?)It's simpleIt's funIt's excitingIt's like a MOBA but funIt has few micro-transactions (I didn't really notice any but I'm pretty sure there are some)It has better animations than the latest Scooby-Doo series.The community isn't toxic (I suggest you become good before it does)Cons:THE TUTORIAL IS SO     ING LONG! THERE IS LIKE TWO PARAGRAPHS WORTH OF INFORMATION IN IT! (and no skip button :P)They didn't explain when the English version is gonna release (not that I'm complaining but it is bad for others)There is a framerate drop.It has a tendency to go into a process of crashing.The main menu may actually never load or show you how to begin to play as there are no buttons or loading signs...If I were you I would begin to play now before everyone else begins too however I'm not you and actually have a life away from the computer screen (the one by the TV where that rusty playstationboy 64 is kept). If you can't speak Russian, I suggest you just watch the gameplay and flashing arrows pointing at cool looking things during the tutorial as you might or might not learn something. If you told me you had a life away from anything electronic related, I would think you were lying and then tell you to wait for the English version but who knows how long that'll take?",2015-10-08,2316,76561197998887921,385530,Astro Lords,0,0,1

You will learn to love it, hate it, despise it and cry over it. Deaths are far too quick to notice where you got shot from. Artillery bombardments make you shake in fear, quiver and panic as you rush frantically to any sort of cover with a roof above your head, only to be blown up mere meters away from safety. Kills are satisfying, requiring patience as a rifleman to ply some of the most awesome kills from afar at unprecedented angles imagined. Have you ever wondered what it's like to shoot at a german stahlhelm slightly sticking out from a trench at over 200 meters from between a broken car's windows? In Red Orchestra 2, you can. When you first start, the game is brutally punishing to you. As a new player, you will die. Treat it like you would treat a boss fight in Dark Souls 2- each death is a learning experience. Soon instead of rushing into a point to secure it, you'll learn to take things slow and have a cautious approach to everything. Cover is essential, but never use the broken cover system. Kills will be far and few in between unless the enemy charges straight on. After putting a few hours into the game, you'll suddenly realize two things: 1. Suddenly, you don't want to be the first to dash between cover. 2. Your aim is steadier under fire. The progression level gives you minimal bonuses that gets better and better the more you play a certain class. For new comers, it is advisable to play as the rifleman class, the most versatile (IMO) class you can choose while not having as much of an impact on a team's potential victory. Get used to bolt action rifles, because those are the most common weapons, but also your most trusthworthy firearm. Of course, the game isn't perfect: Game crashes in between map transitions (for me, at least but I have met a few people suffering from the same issues.) makes for infuriating campaign runs, and rejoining is a pain. Some minor glitches of course (My favourite perhaps was not being able to aim through my M1890 Mosin-Nagant Scope Rifle after dropping from the first floor of a building.) but nothing that detracts from an overall enjoyable (In a slightly masochistic manner) gameplay experience. Well, nothing that can't be solved with a grenade and a suicide.",2024-01-30,121,76561198059566639,35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,53,0,1

The audio, the graphics,  the gameplay, list goes on and on and on. However, despite the sheer awesomeness of this game there are a few problems which i will address : -playerbase/multiplayer wait timeThe amount of time untill i find one player is beyond insane. Prior to buying lethal league i looked at the amount of players present and to my suprise i saw 600-700 people, i thought well, since this is primarily aimed towards multiplayer, the amount of players should fine. A few minutes later i reassured myself and bought it. After the totorial of lethal league i did not waste any time, i decided to play my first lethal league multiplayer match.........It took ages, but then a guy named Squaresx5 saved me from my misery, i pounced in joy breaking my chair in the process. I was so happy, even though i was a noob and knowing that i will slaughtered. -Replay valueI know the time i accumulated is trivial which results in my review being little to no significance, but from first sight, the HUD, the menu and so on i seem to be getting the same message all around the place. CONTENT? REPLAYIBILTY?  but dont get me wrong, it is immensely fun and a good time waster here and then, after awhile though... it kinda loses the appeal, hence people leave. This problem will ultimately affect the player base and the overall longevity of the game.Stuff to consider adding in the future:+stats+stuff to buy and enhance. new abilities?, potions?, weapons?.+faster multiplayer connection+new maps and new characters+new modes+and events+leaderboard?Personal ratingAudio: 9/10Gameplay:8/10Creativity 10/10Graphics 8.5/10Overall a solid  8.875/10 The review written was not to stop you from buying this game but only to inform you of the amount of improvement needed.

It is similar to Fallout: New Vegas in that when you get far enough into it, you are presented with several options to choose which group you want to support. There are 4 to choose from. I THINK. There is a lot to do in the main story and it is just a lot of fun. It does make you think and it offers tough choices at times. The organisation, guild, group, whatever, quests in Fallout 4 are a HUGE let down. They're not an improvement over Skyrim. The copy-paste quests are way too common in Fallout 4. The Railroad, the Minutemen, and you also get them with the Brotherhood of Steel. The quests are literally ""Do this one, simple thing. Come back. Get paid."" It isn't an awe-inspiring quest, it is a chore.﻿ They're not even challenging, just kind of  boring, so you end up not wanting to do them, and people offer them EVERYWHERE!The customisation in the game is very good, sort of. Weapons and armour, including power armour, have a large amount of changes you can make to them. There is also a crafting system for chems. You cannot craft ammunition though, which is just super dumb. You cannot craft weapons either, though I do like that.Power armour in the game is vastly improved over Fallout 3 and NV. It is now an actual suit of armour you need to climb into, instead of it being like some dumb cosplay. You need cores to power them, but ultimately there is not a huge amount of reason to get out of the armour. I like that at times, but I also think it is dumb too.JUNK! There is finally a reason to use it and it is glorious, as there is never enough junk to grab, and you can use it in basically all customisation of weapons and armour. This does turn into the player constantly searching for it though. I guess you can buy it, but that costs caps. Anyway. You're searching for this stuff and there's often a lot of times where you become over-encumbered so you have to choose between weapons or junk. Junk tends to win out a lot.Companions are a massive pain. They're good to talk to, but in combat, they're just useless. They're often in the way, they don't deal much damage, they get in your power armour and don't maintain it, and if you play stealthily, they frequently alert the enemy to your presence because they have no understanding of stealth. They're also weak. It does not take a lot of damage to cause them to sit down. That's right. They can't die, they just sit down when they should have died. Their inability to die is good because if they're carrying stuff, you don't lose it, but bad as it does remove some of the immersion. Enemies, armour, and weapons also level with the player. Ugh. It would be better if there were level locked characters which had these good weapons and armour, but would be too tough for a low level character, but the loot was still in the game from the start, like in Morrowind. Instead, you just have to wait and play the game for better stuff to appear. There are SOME enemies which are set levels, but they special enemies, not enemy types. Like... Ronald is always level 45, but the raider chumps he has are dependent on the player. Ugh.A thing I have noticed, which I loath to death, is that you develop settlements, which is okay, but they're not autonomous. If you do not give them their supplies (beds, water, food, defence), they will not produce them themselves. I don't have enough time, or interest to nanny 20 settlements and make sure they're all cosy and happy. More settlers will arrive at the settlements, but THEY DO NOT DO ANYTHING! THey just sit around.You are also given the opportunity to make the settlements how you want. So you can build houses, place furniture, and generally just make the spaces how you like them. THis is a really good feature, but the buidling can be horrific and frustrating. There are often too little clipping. Some things have this thick, invisible barrier around them, so you can't place things exactly where you want them to be at times. It sucks. Generally though, the building mechanic is well implemented, there are just some dumb issues surrounding it.Oh yeah. Melee combat is dumb. Too much power is put into attacks, which don't do much damage anway, so seeing that is terribly distracting and ruins the immersion a bit for me. It is a good game, it isn't the Elder Scrolls, which I feel I am comparing it to majorly. I do like it though and I have spent too much time over the last few weeks playing. The game draws you in, but it jerks you out with its repetition too.",2015-11-28,176,76561198059611702,377160,Fallout 4,3365,0,1

Beacoup n'aime pas ce jeu car ils ne peuvent le faire tourner sur le ordinateur ou   cause de crash r p titif. Depuis la derni re mise   jour, les nombreux crash ont  t  r ctifi  pour la pluparts. Deplus, je trouve normal que pour un jeu de cette qualit e, il faille-t-avoir un ordinateur correct (voir plus). Mon ordinateur est puissant, mais ce n'est pas le meilleur et pourtant, je fais tourner ACU en qualit   lev  avec seulement quelques ralentissement au niveau des FPS. Pour les combat, g n ralement, je met en qualit e moyenne pour plus de fluidit . Certains sites ont  t  con u pour am liorer vos FPS et empecher votre jeux de crash. Donc avant de le noter, commencer d'abord par tester compl tement le jeu, pas juste le lancer et publier un  val' n gative juste   cause de probl mes de performance. Passons maintenant au jeu en lui m me : Les graphismes sont un point important du jeu que je ne peut que remarquer malgr  ma qualit  graphique moyenne. La carte de Paris    t  totalement reconstitu  ainsi que les grands monument pr sent   l' poque (La cath drale de Notre-Dame, le palais de Versaille, ect) qui ont  t  refait dans les moindres d tails. Le syst me de coop est aussi un des points qui m'a le plus attir  dans ce jeu : la possibilit  de faire les missions   plusieurs, de ce balader dans Paris avec ses potes. Ensuite il a le systeme des armes qui est une grande nouveaut e. Nous ne sommes d sormais plus limiter   une seul classe d'arme : nous pouvons utiliser une lance, une rapi re, un fusil, une masse d'arme ou une hache. Le seul point encombrant est de devoir revenir   chaque fois sur le menu pour changer de style d'arme. En plus de pouvoir choisir entre plusieurs armes, la tenu est elle aussi modifiable, chaque  l ment rajoutant de la sant , de la port e ou de la discr tion.

Les combats ont eux aussi  t  am liorer m me si ils sont assez similaire   ceux de Assassin's creed Black Flag.

Gameplay, you start out with a few workers to build your prison and make money to hire guards and other special workers to make your prison better and sometimes things get out of control real quickly. Audio, sound in this game is pretty good like for example rioting which sounds pretty real in my opinion. Replay ability, this game is flesh every time with new ideas on how to start a prison and manage it. Player friendly, the game is a little complex for new people with micro management and guard management can be tough for new players, plus CCTV cameras and programs. Cons, few bugs and weird graphical glitches  but new updates are always at the end of the month.

Where to start. well for starters, no matter how many other better games you find on steam, Skyrim, The Witcher Wild hunt ANY OTHER GAME! you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will terraria. You will never beat the classics such as minecraft, no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore...... but tbh TERRARIA is     ing amazing!! you think the producers of minecraft have it hard, OF COURSE THEY DO!! its a 3D game, everythings difficult. even tho Terraria is a 2D game it has so much more content including bosses, weapons, biomes, enemies, items, NPC's, tools, ores and A LOT MORE!!! like srrsly you think or minecraft, then think of everything is has. terraria has it but about 5 times more. ESPECIALLY items, terraria has like..... 50 times more items then minecraft. Minecraft just simply cant compete. with terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword, pickaxe and an axe. You find a tree, chop it down, make a house, make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench, some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons, look at wiki or do it yourself. spawn an easy boss and DESTROY!!! it with the AMAZING new weapons you have scavenged and made. collect its drops to save up copper, silver, gold, platnium coins to buy unique items from NPC's such as, awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining. and just when you think its over a meteor lands, you go find its location, (attempt to) mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads, use the meteor armor, weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold. once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons, get better weapons to go aaaallllllll the way down to the underworld (A.K.A HELL!! XD) to mine some hellstone! make a giant pathway thought the underworld, kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll, drop it in lava and summon the WALL OF FLESH with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game.... (killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode) harder enemies, new bosses, destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops, which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine....... ANYWAY i HIGHLY recommend buying this game. HOURS AND HOURS!!!! of fun!! i just.... this game is AMAZING!! please buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to buy this gamebuy this game for themWHATEVER you can you NEED this game to end your sad little life and make it a good oneanyway!!! :) Take Care ;)",2015-05-30,2,76561198059555651,105600,Terraria,644,0,1

On the oother side it a story of a person who deeply cares about his friend and wants to help him somehow but things don't go as planned.

Whether you are sandboxing or playing Trouble in Terrorist Town, you will have lots of fun.This game has many pros. For starters, the incredible physics engine of Source combined with a sandbox game makes for some fun times. This game can be used for making animations, by spawning in ragdolls and positioning them where you want, and finally snapping a picture. You also get a lot for your $10 worth. Not only do you get sandbox (which is fun in itself) but you also have other games by the modding community build for Garry's Mod. These are games such as Stop it Slender, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt and many more. However, this game isn't perfect.This game has a few minor cons that are worth talking about. Firstly, if this is your first Steam purchase, or your first Source game purchase, you may run into a few problems. See, you need to buy a Source engine game. While that wasn't an issue for me (I personally got Steam for Portal once, now I use it much more) others may find themselves not being able to play GMod. Secondly, many of the games require Counter-Strike: Source. This was a problem for me, because I didn't want to pay  $20 for CSS. I was able to get the textures off the internet (legally!) and mod my game so this was fixed, however many users may not want to do this. Finally, when you first play this game, you may have no idea what it is exactly, and just play Sandbox, which can get very boring. There's no guide or help to tell you there's anything else to do.To summerise, GMod is a great game that will keep getting better as it is updated and as the community of modders and other Workshop creators alike grows. However, because of some minor issues, this game deserves an 8.3 out of 10. I recommend this game, and you should definately buy it.",2013-11-25,1,76561198059560580,4000,Garry's Mod,3329,0,1

Moving on as i was saying the cut scences are beautiful especially the waves they are so well done and look so good especially when you just removed 3 random barbians arms and then stuffed it up their arses to the point where there arm is in the back of their throat and just when they start to lose consicousness from the arm you stab them in the throat and watch and 3 more come and try and stand against the glorius roman republic of italy, but like i said this game is wonderfull i really like what the did with the slow mo it feels so rewarding to just MURDER ALL THE     ING JEWS OF BRITTANA WITH THE MIGHT OF A STEEL SWORD AS YOU CUT OFF THEIR      AND FEED IT TO THEIR MOTHERS AS THEY WATCH IN HORROR AS THEIR CHILD IS STRUCK DOWN AND STAB TO PEICES FOR THE SPQR AND SOME TRY TO RUN BUT THEY ONLY GET SO FAR AFTER HAVEING A PILA STUFFED IN THE BACK OFF THEIR HEAD AND SOME FIGHT ONLY TO BE MASSACRED BY THE IRON HORDE OF ROMAN SOLDIERS YOU SWEEP THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE BARBARIANS PELBIAINS SLAUGHTING THEM ONE BY ONE SHOVING YOUR SWORD DOWN THE BACK OF THE THROAT AS YOU SLOWY DIP INTO MADNESS SWING AFTER SWING BECAUSE LESS A MURDER AND MORE OF AN ART, this game shows true power 69/whats left of the roman empire",2024-01-11,81,76561198059803864,302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,329,0,1

RS has a few songs that I wish were in the new one, but 2014 is overall a much more polished version of the system, removing the GuitarHero like style of playing. That being you have to play the notes slightly before they say to on screen or you'll miss them, so in that regard you can't play to the timing of the song very well, which is instrumental in a band, pun intended.Not gonna give pros and cons.Buy 2014 if you want to learn easier.

3014,action,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2012-08-21,14.989999771118164,730,Valve,2012,volka,730,"Basic GameplayYou play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.Positive attributes :- Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)- Ranks  - Cool looking skins- Fast growing population of players  - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often- Chickens- High replay value- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)Negative attributes :Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded.""- The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno""Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.- Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!The volka StrategyYou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy :-  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.-  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.",2014-09-10,29,76561198059555148,730,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2333,0,1

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

I assure you you will find a bug that makes it unplayable.

I know they have a secret... I understand it is part of the story (even if you can't get immersed in the story due to the aforementioned bugs which ruin it)... I can even accept that no one is ever where they are suppose to be (I'm talking to you store owners... 9-5 means 9-5 not 10 and only 10... maybe but fridays only... one day a month) but do the towns folk really have to treat the player like absolute garbage? You move in and they quite literally treat your existance there as a crime... it's a farming sim not a maximum security prison. I have to child proof my house because I am worried my little farming buddy might have some suicidal tendencies with all the from all the abuse. It will make it very hard to forgive them when... if they ever view you as a friend. I can't play the game as it is right now...

It was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2013. I will be honest here, I got into the hype and preordered the game just because I knew that it would be the definitive sequel that GTA IV needed so badly. And the expectations did not fail short from the trailers. I loved it all, the story, the driving, draw distance, shadows, combat and the way the guns feel. Online wasn't great for me but at least I got compensated along with many others, $500,000 from Rockstar themselves as an apology for the issues in October. Overall, it was amazing to say the least with my experience and it was well rendered on 8 year old hardware.Now here comes the remastered version. For Xbox one, PS4, and eventually PC. Now I didn't buy GTA V for the consoles because I knew the PC version would out-class the consoles themselves. And I am happy to report that GTA V runs well on my laptop (don't ask). The texture quality is superbly increased tenfold and makes the game livelier. I got more immersed playing it on PC more than the last gen consoles, but the next-gen would also show similar immersion results. Modding is also an advantage for PC players and you can now rest easy that Rockstar won't ban you for modding in single player. I modded the game to have the scripthook mod and radio stations on foot making the rampages more entertaining than the in-game music. For the graphic obsessed tuners; there are a TON of options to tweak them to your liking with many types of anti-aliasing such as FXAA, MSAA and Nvidia's TXAA. With shadows, AMD has CHS while Nvidia has PCSS. If you are confident in adding more beauty, there is the advanced graphics option and boy, does it punish your PC in performance a lot, but the results are worth it.But wait, there s one thing also that the PC version has that the consoles don't have. Support up to 4K definition. More on 4K later. The movie editor included is a crafty equipment for when you want to make many genres of television and movies or re-create your best moments and brag about in YouTube or the social club.  Personally, I am really confused about how it works but I prefer modding mayhem to anything else. First person mode which was present on the next gen consoles is still present on the PC version and adds an extra layer of immersion to top it off. The animations and the extra detail such as floating garbage on run down streets and cockroaches on the floor in Trevor's Trailer make it more realistic in detail than in third-person. Now about 4K; you need a super SLI or Crossfire to manage up to 60 FPS in performance wise but it pays off as it looks drop-dead gorgeous to look. Also, if you were an originally playing the game before on old-gen and you have a social account linked to you online account for Xbox Live or PlayStation network, you get special perks such as a Railgun, Hatchet, Duke'o death, Stallion, Murder mysteries for noir filters, Animal photography that unlock a new submarine, Dodo seaplane, Monkey mosaics that reward you with a go-go monkey blista and exclusive cars that can be won by racing in new muscle races. Now there are more variety of animals that can be found in the game and you can even play as them by finding peyote plants and chewing on them. Also, there are two new radio stations; one of them is the lab while the other one is Self-radio. Now in order to get it working, put your music in the documents under Rockstar games/GTA V/music and place them there. It s a great update to the game rather than just simply making it nicer for the eyes. (unlike some other games)However, not everything is perfect; several areas of the map can drop the FPS and the launch was a bit of a disaster as people reported that their usernames were causing GTA V to not launch at all. The download times were also painful when you launched the game after you finished you preload because there is a day one patch for the game that is mandatory and it took me almost an hour to launch the game because of the slow download speeds and the size of it. Next thing is, I had to update my drivers because the FPS were fluctuating and it annoyed me beyond irritation. However, this did not stop me from enjoying the game. Also you must have a social account because of the launcher requires it. It will be mostly annoying but seeing as I already created one, it didn't bother me much. (from a techincal POV)The online heists make finally an appearance before and that's also the selling point for going back again. Other than the expanded amount of people that can go into a server up to 30 players, not much has changed.But where does this lead to? Even if it had a few hiccups, The PC version of GTA V is definitely the definitive edition and I do appreciate the effort that Rockstar did even though delaying it is frustrating, the result is a PC game that you shouldn't definitely miss. It towers over GTA IV, Red dead redemption and Max Payne 3 in graphics capability. I can't wait for Rockstar's next big AAA project.Overall for me:10/10 for the PC version9.5/10 for gameplay8.5/10 for the story7/10 for online ",2024-08-19,77,76561197971688382,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,2008,0,1

I soon as i saw it i was hooked, the game looked really fun and amazing. Also it had multiplayer so i could play it with my brothers and friends. Here are the pros and cons!Pros:- Good Graphics (In my Opinion)- Fun- You get a fleet! It looks awesome to go into NLS - Good Combat- Random Events- City Building- Ship upgrades- Cool Explosions- It plays somewhat like a mix between the Spore Civilisation stage and the Space stage- Cool hexagonal territory capture system- Diplomatic, Economic and Militaristic playstyles- Mining- Money!- Doing Distress signals can increase you income! YES!- MultiplayerNow here are the cons. There is one REALLY bad one which seems to only happen to me? It has destroyed me a number of times. What happens is randomly the game will minimase itself and sometimes it wont let me back onto the game so i have to close the game and replay it again. Because of the handy save feature i dont lose any progress. I have died a number of times because it minimises during a heated battle and i cant fight back. It's very annoying.Cons:- Kinda reptitive- Negative dollars =(- Fighting early on can be fatal- Death during NLS charge, lol- random Minimising- Border tension screws you over- Always a pirate base nearbySo to sum it up, this game is absolutuely amazing and should be bought by lovers of space, strategy games. It is a fun game and gives you total freedom to take over the galaxy! Also Multiplayer. I have only played about 4 hours but trust me, that number's gonna get a WHOLE LOT BIGGER!9/10______EDIT_______Now this is something about the game (and my limited techical knowledge and a        router) that really     ing annoys me. Port     ING forwarding! A don't bloody understand how to do that      and i don't think i ever will. It's so god damn confusing. I was really hyped to play with my 2 brothers but NO! The     ing port forwarding     ed everything up! It's soo sad since i really anticipated playing this with my peeps. Sorry if i am a bit angry nut i have been trying to do this      for 3 hours and i realised i have got school in the morning so FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!Sorry about that outburst of rage against this games multiplayer. It's still a really good game but until it gets some sort of proper multiplayer system and not the cheap     port     ing then maybe i will raise the score.6/10",2024-03-28,146,76561198062884389,348490,Beyond Sol,42,0,1

Fallout 3 itself is a remarkable & landmark game, which even tugs at the heart w/ its Main Quest. Also, given the open-world nature of the game and its plenty of side quests to do & land to explore - this continues with making this game a remarkable & landmark game. The game will take the player plenty of hours to complete - at least probably 20+ hours. Now, this isn't even including the 5 DLC's, which also come in this package, each expanding the game at least probably 4-5 hours a piece at least. The DLC's are meaty, each often longer than most new single-player shooter games that cost full price these days! The 5 DLC's expand the game w/ more equipment, quests & areas for the player to explore - Point Lookout & The Pitt are the absolute stand-outs of the DLC's. The User Interface isn't that great, but it is decent enough to get the job done. It could be better - but, that's just a minor complaint. Simply put: if you love RPG's, you absolutely owe it to yourself to play this great game & its DLC's.Grade: A+",2011-12-27,54,76561198059623087,22370,Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition,23,0,1

Under the guidance of the Templars and the prophet Shalun, the Star Traders departed the ruins of the Galactic Core   leaving behind the desolation wrought by the great Galactic War. Guided by the prophet, the Star Traders sought a new home among the stars. Across the multi-generational journey of the Great Exodus, many ships have disappeared, fallen behind, or splintered from the main fleet   scattering the Star Traders to the galactic winds.With the Great Exodus coming to an end, the Star Traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds. The Templar Knights are called upon once again to defend the Star Traders and their new colonies from an ancient threat.Review:Templar Battleforce is a pickup and plays squad tactical grid combat game, with a focus on defending or advancing through swarms of enemies while completing objectives via set scenarios. It shares common ground with other squad tactics games like Xcom and the more recent Warhammer 40K games. It adds its own spin on progression by blending tabletop RPG attributes, light tech tree management, and weapon/gear loadouts to give it its own unique feel and tone to the genre.Some players who may be new to this type of game may find it overwhelming so let s break down the basics. Each turn every character in your unit will have six  move points (MP)  This will allow you to move six squares after using up all MP the character will not be able to move till the next player turn. If you use up all six MP this does not mean you can t attack, for that each character also get five  AP  you will use these to use abilities and attack when it s the players turn. Planning this stage is also recommend since different abilities will use different amounts of AP. You can do this by clicking on a character in your unit then at the button of the screen you will see your characters ability then right clicking on one will tell you how much AP it will use.The game fills great, and from a small indie team they have done an amazing job. You can fill the love and passion they have put into this game. The combat is quick and quite challenging; you can kill an enemy within one turn, tho it can also happen the other way around so you will need to be on your toes with your strategy. In this game you don t just want to grab, shoot get out of there, you will need a plan. It s important to have each member of your squad cover and support one another, because if any single member is left exposed they will quickly be overwhelmed. At the end of the day crowd control is the key of the game, you are also often playing against the clock. You re encouraged to race through and complete each scenario as fast as possible. If you stay put and try to bide your time you will usually lose by getting overwhelmed.One of the great things within the combat turn is  free forming  where any of your characters can do any action in any order you wish, You don t even have to use them all before moving to another character or ending your turn. This was a nice change from the normal, you have to do it in this order or else type gameplay and opens up the strategy and adds a new layer of gameplay.Progression is handled within the game a couple of different ways. One of them is with the  Requisition  system or skill tree. On First glance there is a lot going on here but the Requisition is broken down into sections like engineer, scout, soldier, captain and so on, you can pick the skills in order of what type of unit you want to play and focused on.Other ways are with traditional skills and attributes, as well as weapon/armor/augment loadout you take into battle.There is some light customization with a color swap, portrait swap and renaming to personalize, but it is not very in depth. Some more options and perhaps different graphics for the more robust armor and weapons would help give the characters a little more distinction and personality.The game also haves things called  Tactical Points"" that you can capture and control on the map. They generate currency over time you can use to resupply, deploy extra squad members and give your squad bonuses. Tho be careful the enemy can and will try to destroy these  Tactical Points,  so I always felt compelled to protect them and at some points it can be critical in some levels. However, it can also be a misleading lure; where you could get caught up in stands off against the enemy when you should instead be pushing ahead.The UI in the game is easy to use and to understand, I like the style and fit s the game it does not feel out of place. The games UI also haves some useful tooltips for most elements in the game and does a good job of explaining. You can also change the UI by hitting  TAB,  this will allow you to see all characters within your unit.Music in the game I quite liked for an indie game tho nothing stood out, some are catchy and help capture the mood, but some tracks seem cut short and can become weary after several plays. Sound effects are also serviceable but nothing amazing. The game is also all text based with no voice acting but that was expected due to voice acting costing a lot, and if they went the cheap route it would have ended badly.Let s talk about the story. I was surprised with how it expanded and was not expecting much from it due to it being a squad tactical game, it could however, be more robust. That is not saying it s not any good and that you should skip away. The story does give you hints and what you should do among other things. The focus however is on the combat and how you handle it yourself in battle. Most of the plot and background development will happen through cut scenes, monologs, dialog trees and discussions with the fellow crew at headquarters. It would have been nice if it tied in with more of the other Star Traders games.The graphics in the game are not bad, it haves a nice grunge alien look to them. Some people may find it bland and, or lacking, This is an indie and graphics comes second to gameplay and everything else. The main seller for this game is the combat, and they did an amazing job of that. Templar Battleforce has made a better tactical strategy games, and then most other AAA ones that have come out in the past couple of years.Another thing I really liked about this game is when you start it up, I love the main menu in this game, it just set the mood for myself the subtle animation and effects used in it was great.Read the review @ {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/1One2H3With that all said I found my self-liking this game much more than I originally thought I would, and I kept wanting to come back for more, so with that said I give the game 8/10. I can t wait to see what game they come up with next.To learn more about the game you can head over to the website at: {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/1NoPgWP or you can buy the game now on Steam for $9.99 USD at: The game is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.Learn more:Website: {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/1NoPgWPSteam: {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/1Gxb4YnOmni Horizon : www.omni-horizon.com",2015-10-08,174,76561198079339411,370020,Templar Battleforce,87,0,1

Even with both Anti-cheats systems in place, lots of people still hack in this game, which makes the game unplayable and unenjoyable.A typical run in Rust begins with you running for 2 minutes, then being head shotted or instantly killed by a fellow player. This is what happens 90% per cent of the time to players who don't hack while the cheats can do as they please because they are armed to the teeth. The community in this game is a joke (more like a community of trolls and angry children), which most people just kill you for the hell of it. There is no team work or friendly people to build alliances with in this game and it in the end becomes a battle between you and the hackers/ hacker groups, which you don't stand a chance. To sum this game up, is to say that it is a run and get gunned down simulator, unless of cause you use hacks.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP GAME!

The game requires you to find the missing value in various area puzzles, the twist is that the puzzles can only be solved by whole numbers and not fractions or decimals.QualityGraphics - The graphics in Pythagoria have a simple look giving it a nice modern touch. The puzzles themselves are drawn nicely reminding me of a blueprint of a house or building. Overall the graphics are drawn in great quality.Sound - Pythagoria contains a very calm sountrack that sooths you when playing and keeps the stress down from the puzzle. The game includes a few different tracks instead of just one to keep the lack of boredom up.Gameplay - The gameplay is pretty self explainable in Pythagoria, after you pass the first puzzle you'll get hang of it quite nicely. The controls are really simple, the puzzles aren't as easy though, the help section is quite helpful with some tricks and suggestions on how to solve the puzzle, but you still have to use your brain for this one guys! :PPros & ConsPros:- Easy Controls- Interesting and Unique Gameplay- Has cards (In the making)- Soothing Soundtrack- Challenging Twist (Counters to shortness of the game)- Great Developer (Kind and is concerned about the community of his game)- Has working out tools on right hand side (Pencil and Eraser)Cons:- Can Restart (Can't restart game or tutorial)- Not customisable (Can't change colour or font of pen and you can only erase everything on screen instead of one thing)Suggestions- Make Pen and Eraser Customisable (as in colourConclusionTo conclude, Pythagoria is a well-made brain teaser for those who want a challenge, especially for a price of $1.99. I do hope the developer continues to work on it, by providing more puzzles and more customisability.  9/10 ^^My rating For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!

Try not to shed a tear for your little virtual peeps as they migrate, make friends, do science and fight to the death all under your direction.

I uplifted cockroaches and allowed them to own an entire sector. After a grueling war they saved my economy.

You can spend your early hours with the game just wandering through the woods or searching empty houses for supplies. The game offers very little in the way of guidance when you start. Once you finally get some decent gear, you can lose it in a flash if you're caught by surprise by a couple zombies or a trigger happy player. Still, the loose and harsh nature that many people hate about DayZ is also why people love it. Yes, finding fresh food or water so you won't die can be annoying. On the other hand, it forces players to converge on the supply-rich towns where the zombies are most concentrated. The hunt for scarce resources and ease of death forces players to either band together, hunt each other, or become sneaky hermits. You can make the game into a co-op shooter, survival horror, deathmatch, or somewhere in between. The game's what you make of it. 8/10",2014-12-17,77,76561197971688382,221100,DayZ,170,0,1

For all it's flaws however, which are far too many than should be, the gameplay is pretty darn good fun, especially when you play with other people. The new parkour system is both better and worse than the old system, but for the most part is better, more fluid and dynamic. The combat is also quite satisfying, more challenging, gone are the days of being a one man army, in are the days of (to a certain degree) skill based hack and slash. The customisation in the game is better then any previous title in the franchise and there are a lot of different styles and choices to personalize your character which is great. The story was in my opinion, interesting, it is somewhat a cross between previous titles and black flag, an assassin vs templar's story like the old titles, but also a personal story like black flag. The bugs...the bugs in this game are horrendous, as is the optimization. I haven't encountered the infamous 'no face bug' but l have encountered quite a lot of crashes, some crashes which even forced me to restart the game as they caused my save to corrupt. So on one hand, you could see it as the game is so bad in the sense that it crashed so frequently and even forced me to restart (l'm currently on my fourth playthrough), On  the other hand however, it can also be seen from a positive perspective, being the game is that fun that l was willing to play through the game four times from start to finish.

Allowing Land and Air vehicles to be driven or flown, none of the vehicles feel over-powered or under-powered, with each vehicle having it's weaknesses. Ground PvP warfare is fun and exciting, having to rely on cover, teammates and a steady hand makes this game fun. Although the leveling system is quite slow, and gaing in-game cash [CERTS] is painfully slow [30 certs per 1 hour long session, average gun = 500c] it doesn't matter as the default guns are good as they are. Capturing points is very fun... for the defenders, fighting to the last man to hold that lab is something i find thrilling. As with attacking, after you've captured the point, the enemy team get transferred to some sort of saferoom that you have to unlock by completing a task. HALF the friggin' team doesn't know what they have to do and 45% of the people that do know what to do are ranting on in the chat that, 'These n00bs need to hurry up and cap the thingy-stuff *Gibberish* ' Which the confuses the players even more as they don't know what the hell they are talking about.Things to improve:> Quicker leveling> Quicker in-game cash collecting> More obvious side task notifications Out of 10:8.75 Would prefer if it was a bit more fast paced, but the game is fine as it is.",2013-12-25,6,76561198059561486,218230,PlanetSide 2,0,0,1

The lore is intriguing and the writing is very well thought out.There hasn't been any other game that utilises an in-game narration that comments on what you do in the game, nor has it ever been used as a story-telling technique. This game is pretty much the paragon of this idea if it were ever to be used again. Logan has also done narration for Dota 2 in the Bastion Announcer pack and I say it would be well within reason to buy it simply for his dedication - I've checked and it's about 30mins worth of lines for every situation in Dota 2.Don't do 'No-sweat Mode', it's pointless and the game already has an in-game difficulty changer through the use of God-shrines, each having a unique effect on AI behaviour. And the challenges in the game are definitely not easy.Favourite things: Spike on a Rail, Zia and Zulf's Theme both sung wonderfully and simply. Original ideas of level design and progression through an actual world that builds itself as you move around. Secrets are also well rewarding. There's even a special secret with a certain three-legged robot. Works perfectly with a controller - tight and responsive. Keyboard not really recommended for the fact it can get VERY hectic at certain levels and certain degrees of dexterity is needed not able to be provided by the keyboard.Motionjoy + Playstation 3 USB controller can be used in place of a XBOX360 controller.",2013-01-06,300,76561198059582003,107100,Bastion,65,0,1

But playstyle is the true casualty here. The combat from the 2cnd game heck even the first has been taken out, stripped for parts,       with a hammer than lazily slopped back in -easily the worst of the franchise their is no variation u have to go in guns blazing full board with no other option. enemy ai will not allow for control or long range options they will charge your position or grenade spam and their is nothing u can do about it -cover is worthless this time round and any slam or grenade hits will send you flying due to gravity.Gravity is the absolute worst mechanic ever introduced into a fps, it ruins everything it touches in this game, the lack of atmosphere makes exploration painful and not worth the effort, the use of said atmo in combat and the forced nature of its use is just extra frustration, the jump mechanics to get it to work can be fiddly and again frustrating with fire being able to knock u out or lock u into a low burn so very easily. the slightest hit with a nade or slam will throw u from cover and often off of cliffs or walls -into hazards etc with nothing u can do about it. lunatics this games versions of psycos especially can just be a pain to deal with as they rush ur position and spam ground slams.Vehicles, this game introduces 2 new ones and they are shocker -absolutely terrible, the game throws ALOT of vehicle jumps at u especially early on but the first car can barely make any of them and will often just zoom straight off into the beyond -the game gives u the 2cnd vehicle early and while it can make the jumps its this lame as slow wanna be bike or speeder thing -just soo much fail.Finally the laser weapons -my god f the damn laser weapons -in a players hands they are terrible ammo horing weapons dealing little damage per ammo but in the enemy hands they will rend your sheilds and health faster than a rocket round, the ai is extremelly acurate as they are in all borderlands and these enemies can fly and manipulate the gravity it's just frustration to deal with them with all the other factors in play.",2014-12-24,1409,76561197971666535,261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,181,181,0

Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the ""passive"" way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you're one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it's so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus.

(and it only really starts getting fun with a third (or more) person(s) too)...To those having a Party with a few friends around, Must grab.To those looking for a single player experience, Don't get it yet, Wait a few months and see how the single player modes progress and then re-evaluate Swordy is a Unique ""Arena Party Game"" In the vein of ""Starwhal"" or ""Duck Game"" or ""SpeedRunners"". They are great, fun, and silly... though there's a few drawbacks out there.Most of these Arena party games are platformers... and too many people have WAAAY different skill levels in platformers to make them fun or fair.This game is a lot more like starwhal ""new"" control scheme, a game where most people are unfamiliar with the controls, starting everyone off on a level playing field. What this game has going for it is a really strong sense of ""Honourable combat"", ""Casual rulemaking"" and ""Improvisation mid combat""""Looking at each other across the arena, blood has been spilled, but both your weapons are aflame... the rain starts... everything else seems to fade into the background, Slowly spinning up the hammer, charging forwards, both you and them start screaming...""Moments like that seem to flow and occur naturally, Blows and weapon exchanges seem just right, your opponents rarely outskill you to the point of futility, and when amazing dagger throws do happen, there's nothing but awe across the couch. It feels like one of the few local multiplayer games where battlecries feel appropriate and easy to do. The game is really good at encouraging ""epic memorable moments"", everything feels fair (even when it's unfair).The game is also nice in offering casual rulemaking. You have an immediately apparent unspoken social contract for politeness, a weapon selection as required, not needing to go into a ""Mutators screen"" to disallow certain items... as most friends are amiable to not allow swords, or to only go for punches, or overhead attacks... it's just really nice and refreshing not having to go back out to a menu to get that stuff done.It's also really nice to see a bit of panic mode support, where your thrown weapon misses the target, and now you're running away from a psycho with a flaming spear, grabbing and tossing everything in your path to try escape... until either you manage to pick up another dagger and fling it at him... hopefully with a little more luck this time... or you run into a wall and get skewered...Really, this is just an essential party game that doesn't lose it's lustre quickly, Get it if you're sick of platformers as your only party game options for sure. Get it if you're the type that can convince their friends to bring two controllers over.Remember that you hold X while picking up to dual wield!",2024-07-24,48,76561197975627080,467900,SWORDY,1,0,1

It is really annoying when you finish an event and keep clicking 'Enter' to quit, and you end up starting another event. I believe most of players would take a break from playing or have some time to check the upgrades that have just been unlocked from the previous match.2. There should be a warning when purchasing cars that you can't even use for the chamipionship until 20 events later. (I kept saving up using my 60's mini to buy an M3, thinking I will be doing 80s events after getting it, then I found out you have to progress from the 60s to the era that you want to play. Come on Codemaster, just make all eras available at once, most people born in the 1980s wouldn't have much interest in those 1960 or 70s old school cars)3. Give us the option to turn off not only the main menu music, but also the ones between race loading, that music is not appealing to everyone, and to me it is annoying.4.

I would describe it as: Awesome, a lot of fun, hilarious and brilliant. Although it does forget the realism (almost completely) in the SR series, it opens for a lot of opportunities such as: Super Powers and aliens. Run and jump around an invaded Steelport, fighting the police and aliens with customisable weapons, vehicles and of course super powers. Telekinesis, fireballs and stomping are only highlights of what mayhem you can cause with the press of a button. Open up your game for friends to join in on the action, LAN or Online. They can help complete the story and bonus activities found around Steelport. With fun DLC's, the fun doesn't end when the story does. I recommend this game to you because of: The open world sandbox map, the variety of weapons and vehicles, the use of super powers, and the fun multiplayer mode.

With better graphics, new weapons and a nicer and easier interface to use, this game is truely a treat to get instead of of it's predecessors.Some bad things about this game are that it's graphics are now outdated compared to it's successors and that you can only play co-op multiplayer (only 2 players), so you can't play a giant rampage with 3 or more friends.In my final opinion, this is a fun and great game to play and have, especially if you have played any previous games in the series, even if you finished the game you can still play around with the game for as long as you want!This review was made with the help of my good friend ""MCZ - 1989""",2015-09-26,121,76561198059566639,55230,Saints Row: The Third,129,0,1

Oh boy, I was wrong. When I clicked the play button, I've suffered enough already and quickly uninstalled it. RaceRoom Racing Experience is a crap game with a load of bullcrap in it and shouldn't be bought by all people for eternity.Yes, the game's graphics and details are pretty good until your ""racing experience"" being annoyed by the terrible car handling and Playstation 1 car sounds. Believe me, handling in here is screwed up and probably the most annoying thing you will encounter in the game. Cars will spin out like crazy with no control at all. This is no racing simulator, it's just a game with glitchy cars spinning around and hit each other.So my final verdict is that, while the game has realistic graphics, the terrible handling just hindered you for maintaining the real racing experience. The game does have a lot of potential, but SimBin, the developers, executed this in a wrong way and that chance is gone forever, and it wouldn't able to compete with current racing games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and Grid.Although patches has been released, still, they're too late to fix RaceRoom's glitchy and broken gameplay.And although I played RaceRoom for a short time, 15 minutes is enough for you to suffer from it's crappy gameplay.Sorry, SimBin, but I have to give this game a 3/10 :(",2014-04-04,52,76561197971799589,211500,RaceRoom Racing Experience ,104,0,0

It seems hopeless, but you find your weapons intact and functional. You search the skies for a chance to see another life pod. A chance for someone to be with you, A chance to survive, but you only see storage units falling you say' ""Must of been from the ship"". Alas, hopelessness grips you again. You shout of sorrow, not because of not seeing another life pod from the ship, but because knowing your the only one that survived and with what you have seen, the ship must of been destroyed. You place your weapon on your head knowing there is no chance of survival and prepared to shoot, but wait?!?!? You see the ship landing 10 miles away. With new found hope you ready your weapons and journey through this God forsaken planet. You start with the Commando. A very agile and powerful character if matched with the right items. With him you'll learn how to kite, how to dodge and how every damage to an enemy counts. Gameplay is smooth and fun. Controls are quite simple. It's an addictive game and has great replay value.The music is fantastic. It has achivements that you need to unlock for new items or characters (Yes I'm looking at you achievement hunters). You can choose from 10 different characters (If you unlock them all that is) and not every run is the same. But a few achievements based items are impossible to get and multiplayer is buggy. Most new player will completely lost on what to do and die in the 10 min mark. I wouldn't recommend this too everyone, but If you love platform and shoot em' up games. I can easily recommend this to you.  I'd this give game 8.5/10.

Its fine orchestral melodies give a fantastic atmosphere in-game. The combat system is pretty basic and lovely, I am still not a fan of it since I prefer more of a Turn-Based Mechanic like Civilization and so on. Still its good but I stress everytime when I am doing a move and if I click on the wrong menu I am losing precious seconds giving the enemy AI an opportunity to defeat my party. The Story is great, you play as a Dark Knight called Cecil (Or in my game    ) who follows the orders of supreme tyrant king. He and his Red Wings go to the City of Mysidia and attack on its peaceful people for its crystal. I won't go on any longer with the story, but becomes interesting the more you know. The Characters in game are all facinating and quite lively, the cut-scenes in the game include voice-overs which I found great. Finally, Final Fantasy IV succeeds on being a True JRPG, the only thing I had problem with  was what to do next? In this game, I am told what to do and when accomplish I just don't know what to do or go where. A bit more guidance in-game would have done the trick. Also this game has very good ""Engrish,"" you will notice some when you read the text carefully.Overall this game I found it a  good rendition on my Steam Library and cannot wait for more of the Final Fantasy Games to get on steam. The is excellent fulfulling what a JRPG should do with excellent music, interesting story and well-thought characters. In addition, has some faults with guidance in-game and contains some well written ""Engrish.""",2014-09-19,121,76561197974524478,312750,FINAL FANTASY IV,0,0,1

The single player is a fun experience with no real problems, so read on. Okay, so you are wondering if GTA ONLINE would be a fun experience... Well it is, if you can actually make it into a server without the game putting you in singleplayer for no reason... My favourite is when you connect to a server but the Rockstar cloud services screw up and you can't save any progress :^( What's the point of waiting for those incredibly long loading screens for something that is just stuffed?...You run out of stuff to do eventually Heists become a chore or (mostly) unplayable if you don't have friends there, races and stuff are always won by sweaty plebs that do nothing but learn each race track all day and to top it all off, hackers can hack with ease and with little indication of slowing down... Yes, they remove your guns, can't be killed, spawn NPCs and other objects and also have the ability to blow up everyone on the server at once, thus making the freeroam experience broken as hell.DO NOT buy this game until a price drop even if bonus GTA online cash is offered...

It's hard, people kill you, monsters kill you either way someone will probably loot your corpse and take all your stuff. I really enjoy it like that. Also I don't think you can get a house unless you sub. But I really don't think that it is that bad. Look at World of Warcraft, They have the same cost subscription but you also have to spend alot just buying the game for somethng that repetitive. My stat side of the reviewGraphics 6/10. It's better than Half Life but not as good as Half Life 2 graphics.Gameplay 9/10. It plays alot like Mount & Blade and there is just so much freedom.Community 8/10. Only thing that annoys me about the community are the people who       about it, Like I said it doesn't suit everyone, if you don't like it don't       about it to everyone who likes it just log off and go play something else.Crafting 7/10.

Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.",2014-06-04,75,76561198059768123,201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,0,0,1

Because I'm crazy and so are you!Rage mode review:Unturned is a game that will make you rage. Death is your constant companion because of the rules that KOS applyby default on servers, according to players that play online atleast. Why? because it's an infinitely repeating cycle. Once one player killed someone without questioning why, that guy started doing the same.

Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a funky-    broad permittizzle fo' exploration n' a wide selection of buildin decor, itz tha type of game dat strikes me as havin suttin' fo' everyone. Which is good, when you consider dat it also has multiplayer n'     . Even mo' betta when you git ta tha late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors n' tools ta allow fo' a wide variety of specializations.Buildin n' exploration is phat points up in favor of tha game yo, but tha gameplay mechanics is suttin' I'd like ta single up fo' praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a          of spectacle, n' like thatz part of why I find it so charmin yo. Hurtin enemies--even dem playas whoz     is vastly inferior ta you--feels good. Y'all KNOW dat     , mutha    a! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! It aint nuthin but satisfyin ta hear tha hit sound on tha mo' squishy enemies, n' peep dem explode tha      into fine lil chunks when they take a thugged-out dirt nap. Ground movement could be mo' betta yo, but certain late game      hit you wit tha mobilitizzle ta dash n' fly, which straight-up expand how tha      you can explore n' fight fo' realz. And wit a wide selection of weapons, every last mutha    in playa is bound ta find a rosta of tools, spells n' fish-related artillery dat fits they playstyle.Da game aint without flaws, mind yo thugged-out    . With tha gamez update history, tha launch endgame now vastly differs from dat of tha current one. This has hustled ta some balizzle n' progression issues, da most thugged-out glarin of which bein how tha      sluggish tha early game feels. Well shiiiit, it worries me dat tha start of tha game might dissuade some playas from playing, when they might ludd what tha      tha late game has ta offer n'     . Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact. Even though I have mo' ta say bout tha shortcomings, there be a just too much phat up in tha game ta stay mad bout what tha      effectively boils down ta nitpicking.Plus, it has hats fo' realz. Any game dat has a selection of basebizzle caps gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other props. If dis be lookin like suttin' you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a cold-    lil chance. Da game occasionally goes on sale fo' 75% off, so pick up a gangbangin' four pack fo' yo     n' three playas. If I be wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I be sorry as a mutha    a bout dat        t. But if I be right, then it'll be well worth tha price. We sposed ta     in pay $60 these minutes fo' a gangbangin' fulfillin gamin experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.

I'd never given the first Witcher game a chance, and when I upgraded my GPU I thought I'd skip it and start the second instalment instead.I very nearly stopped playing at the end of the first chapter, more specifically, during the boss battle with that-other-Witcher in the game. I'm not kidding, it took me almost 30 attempts and I realised that after a whole chapter, I'd learnt very little in terms of fighting technique. For me, the game was hard. Incredibly so, not least because I'd made the mistake of not exploring enough and looking for/crafting the best gear.In the end, I persisted and the game got easier insofar as my Geralt character improved a bit. The game can be unforgiving in parts, and there is a real sense of progression when you do advance.I've finished the game, but feel I've only scratched the surface and I'm keen for another playthrough.

But aside from that its overall a good game with some Quirks to, In the start and does a good job of making you care and feel for the charecters.Graphics...For them to go with this style was definately a good choice the graphics arant super ultra realstic, They take a more comic book art style and the reason why it fits the game better is becuase the Walking dead started in comic book form, And for them to interigrate the same style into a game and make it look Brillent then stick with it, Not only does it make the game more timeless but make you feel like that your in the comic book following the story of someone else.The Zombies in this game, in the first season they reused alot of zombie skins and it seems like they will do the same in season two and to be honest the skins are pretty cool and so is zombie animation the Reused Zombie skins could use abit more randomiztion but overall excuseble given the amount of time these poeple have, Gotta scarfiece something right?This game is fine sometimes quirky and extremly emotional if your looking for a game to rip out your heart then patch it up t only rip it right back out again, This is your game.Review by Reaver and the Doctor, Friend me if you wanna get you game reviewed or get a opinion till then, Derp on.",2014-02-24,300,76561198059582003,261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,40,0,1

I was later led to disappointment as I realized just how little story there actually is and that the game relies on using cliffhangers to keep the player going. I was fine with this until I completed the game and was left quite unsatisfied. The game made me very eager to see just what would happen next as I swung from stage to stage hoping that I'd get some dialogue. The ending left me quite disappointed as I saw the developer could've done much more with the game. A lot of players have trouble with this game (refer to the other reviews for this, mostly the negative). I find that this is what gives players their play time. The developer is asking $13 for a game that could take a player 1-3 hours to complete (depending on just how much they die).-----------------------------------------------------Pro/Con VersionPros- What little dialogue there is can drive your curiosuity enough to keep you playing.- Amazing atmosphere.- Fun gameplay.Cons- Very little dialogue.- 1-3 hours of gameplay.- Monotone narrator/unconvincing voice actors (don't let the narrator's beautiful voice fool you!)- Massive price tag for how long the game is.-----------------------------------------------------Conclusion: I'd say get it on sale, it's a very fun game however its price tag is just quite demanding. For a story based game the story really isn't there; the atmosphere is. You could get something that'll get you more for your buck elsewhere.",2024-07-07,127,76561198059687929,278360,A Story About My Uncle,305,0,0

This is followed by the first dungeon, in which isaac needs to use his own tears to fight the monsters within. That sounds bad enough, however throughout the game, more disgusting content is clear. As isaac finds powerups, he attatches them to his body in the most gruesome way possible.  This game has reduced any sense of respect i had for team meat and I would never want to meat this author.

The villiam has great writing, I can't press this enough, it's just so good!*THe humor is pretty good, whether you're climbing a nuke, or you're in a 60's sitcom, you'll get a laugh out of this game.*The graphics (on max settings) weren't improved by much, but they still look pretty good.*A bunch of the side mission/activities are extremely fun to play (fraud being my favourite)*optimisation is extremely good in the single player*There's a bunch of gun custimisation, you can make your pistols into robo cops gun!CONS-*Gunplay seems to be just an after thaught in this title, the game kind of expects you to just use your super powers, which is nice and all, but I like scoring 5 headshots in a row with robo cops gun. *While there is alot of gun custimisation, it all seems reduntant once you get super powers, which is a shame because there are some really cool skins for your guns (the pulse rifle, for example)*Just like guns, cars become obselete once you get your super powers, this is made worse by the fact that the new/improved car custimisation system is awesome! Unfortunately, the game basically punishes you for using cars.*Like many people, I believe the game gives you super powers far too early. If they had given them to you perhaps half way through the game, this would help with the redundancy of the cars/guns.*co-op is LAGGY!!!! It's seriously un playable at times, if you want this game for co-op, you have been warned.MIDDLE-*They basically re used the same map from saints 3, and added a few things here and there. I don't really hate that, I mainly just thought ""after you guys decided this would be a full game, couldn't you at least give us a new map to run around in??""VERDICT--Saints row 4 is a worthy addition to the saints row franchise, it has great humor, addicting gameplay amongst all the other great things about this game. There are a few problems, but they don't really take away from the experience or the fun to be had here. Unfortunately, this is basically the last game in the franchise, I suppose it's good it ended on a good note then!I would definately reccomend this (I don't use a number system because it's flawed)",2015-09-11,300,76561198059582003,206420,Saints Row IV,1911,0,1

It has got an option to go premium, but this is un-intrusive and doesn't completely throw things out of balance. You can also use real money to buy ""Galaxy Cash"". You can spend Galaxy Cash to buy cubes (What you use to build your robot), instead of the normal currency, which isn't TOO bad, but still not great. The worst this ""Pay to Play"" aspect ever gets (In my opinion) is that you can use GC to convert normal Tech Points into Uber Tech Points. The normal TP are tiered, so you can not get Tier 7 TP on your first battle, and better armor, weapons, utilities and wheels/hoverblades are on a higher tier. Anyway, I can use GC to convert my Tier 2/3/etc. TP into Uber TP. Uber TP can be used for ANY upgrade, but you only have access to any below you or one above you. This means that someone with what is essentially a rocket launcher can go against other people you don't have rocket launchers. The thing is, though, is that hardly anyone gets premium or buys GC. Which means that everything I just said isn't really a problem. The actual game is very addictive, and lots of fun. All in all, I think that unless you reckon that ""It's the thought that counts"" when it comes to using real money in games, this game is worth the $0 it costs, and I would still buy it for $10 or even $15.

It's at this point that the game stops being a survival game, an starts to be an unpaid fulltime job. See the promise of a survival game is that the longer you play, the more survivable & fun it becomes as you master your terrain. Ark on the other hand, the more work you put in, the more work there is to put in. Once you've built your house of straw, it's on to your house of wood, once you've got your house of wood, it's on to the house of stone & it's like that with literally everything in the game: There is no pay off.An if you are the least bit effective early on in the game, the leveling system outstrips the actual content, in that it stops being a survival game & rapidly becomes an eating, drinking & pooping simulator, because thats what you spend your entire time doing, as you wait for your xp to bring you up to the next level.As for the PVE aspects of the game they leave a lot to be desired. Dinosaurs just mill around, instead of moving with any purpose, and there are just way to heavily packed together on a map that is way to small. God help you if you don't stick to the beach the entire time, because predatory dinosaurs are so common place off the beach that it often feels like you are being Zerged by small predatory dinosaurs, or worse yet the insects.Which brings me to my next issue: Movement tracking. I don't mind combat with the dinosaurs, or at least i wouldn't if i ever got in to combat with the dinosaurs, rather than shadow boxing the fart of existance that the program thinks are the dinosaurs locations, when actually the dinosaur is three feet, that a way.The game lacks for telegraphing so dinos attack, before lacky banding back to the location they were in, without passing through the space between. The worst offenders are the spitting dinosaurs & the raptors, but it's alsoa problem with any of the insects, and even the Bronto's who kill you by magic apparently, because you'll never see what they hit you with. I'm sure there is a playable game under there somewhere, but it's not nearly as deserving of praise as it's currently getting.",2015-08-09,54,76561198059602670,346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,82,0,0

17818,Unknown,War Thunder,1970-01-01,-1.0,236390,Unknown,1970,K3nokis,236390,"Excellent game made by skilled artists and 3D modellors. The team that manages the engine and physics are quite good, though not the best. Aircraft and vehicle modelleling is the greatest I've seen for a game with such a variety of vehicles. Gameplay is amazingly smooth and simple.I cannot recommend it due to many controversial decisions made by the developers. Ignoring the playerbase in terms of balancing the matchmaking. Gaijin have created a problem that only becomes worse. When there are many players playing a large range of vehicles, (generally) effective matchmaking would clump a few evenly matched vehicles together for an intense fight.However if a vehicle was introduced/""balanced"" to be too effective/ineffective, naturally people would flock/avoid that vehicle. This creates increased queue times due to the inbalance of demand of vehicles. People complain and Gaijin allows a wider variety int he one game, this can (and did) lead to further imbalance. Thus, more people avoid it/leave. This makes the balancing act harder and both Gaijin and the playerbase stressed.Of course, this depends on your reason on playing War Thunder and the matchmaking may not be a concern, also Gaijin isn't doing too badly at the moment, it's just greatly inconsistent matchmaking leading to either utter defeat or victory simply due to vehicle selection and not player skill.Any aircraft could easily kill a much higher tiered aircraft if they're not using their speed advantage or experience. I have killed MiG-15's in an F6F Hellcat. However in ground forces, it is practically impossible to kill a much higher tiered tank due to their armor and firepower keeping you at a massive disadvantage.Game Modes:Arcade Battles:Best place to learn the ropes, manoeuvres target leading, positioning, awareness and map knowledge. Physics have been tweaked for faster gameplay and easier to handle aircraft. This mode is where I spent about half of my time on, learning how to fly different types of aircraft and their weapons. Ground forces arcade is very intense and can be very much run, gun, die repeat. Dodging cannons rounds and ramming enemies off cliffs.Realistic Battles:Common for more skilled players like myself. Vehicles perform closely to historical documents (which aren't the most accurate due to multiple sources). Requires extensive knowledge of own vehicle, enemies and map to effectively defeat the enemy. In this game mode, teamwork and communication is also introduced. (Yes, teamwork and communication is almost non-existent in arcade) NOTE: Although teamwork is indeed key, people are people and will sometimes be selfish or ignorant which can lead to many losses. You basically have to hope that your team isn't braindead to charge the enemy into a disadvantaged position.Simulator Battles:What is this? DEAD :(In aircraft used to force cockpit views and requires a joystick (although with practice you can go without). It tries to have the primary components of real combat without having to worry about issues real pilots have. Can be very intense however it has an extreme learning curve and almost certainly requires a wingman. Like RB, however these skills are truly put it to the test.The game indeed has its great moments, when the odds are stacked even greater against you than the developers intended and you still break through. However too often you'll just die hopeless, with the only way of avoiding it is to drag out the match.",2015-12-20,121,76561198059566639,236390,War Thunder,17,0,0

Although we only have Episode One as of this review, it's safe to say that Telltale has done an incredible job and I cannot wait to see more episodes and perhaps even future seasons.  Pros  Immersive as hell. The atmosphere, story, character development, everything was amazing.  Detective work. Incredible voice acting all around. Really digging Troy Baker as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It's a Telltale Batman game. That speaks for itself. Fight scenes in this are amazing. Camera angles, the intensity, everything about them make you feel like the Batman.  Choosing your plan of attack is awesome. Hope to see this feature used more in future episodes.  Cons   Performance issues. Won't dwell on this too much, has already been discussed to death. Not really a con but, first episode was a little slow paced. I personally didn't mind this but some may be a bit put off by the large amount of dialogue. Overalll Score: 8.5/10.Once future patches are released that deal with the current performance issues, I Strongly reccomend purchasing this. Personally, it is my favourite Telltale Game since the first season of The Walking Dead. Adding on from that, not everyone will face issues with running the game so I strongly suggest getting it to either give it a go or just wait until the patches roll on out. Strongly reccomend this game, get it whenever, you most likely won't regret it.",2024-08-07,373,76561197972244272,498240,Batman - The Telltale Series,0,0,1

The only semi-decent thing this game even has is mod support, some of the mods are better than the base game itself, and are even free.To me this game is unplayable without mods.And do yourself a favour, if you already have Assault Sqaud, don't get this game, but if you don't mind numerous bugs, crashing multiplayer, underwhelming graphics and single player campaigns, DLCs aimed to make you pay MORE money to get features which should've been in the base game and a overall disappointing game for any REAL strategist out there. If you don't mind all this than this ""game"" is for you.",2015-10-22,72,76561198060013930,244450,Men of War: Assault Squad 2,108,0,0
